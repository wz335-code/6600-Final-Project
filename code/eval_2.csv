"Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and rose all the way to its top but even he struggles to recall a Latin American year like 2019. “Like this? Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim worked for Brazil for a long time. He worked in the foreign service for almost 60 years. He got to the top job. But he said he can't remember a year like 2019 in Latin America.

""Like this? Never before,"" he said. He was talking about the problems in Latin America in 2019. There were many social and political problems. These problems happened in many countries, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá.

The year started with problems in Venezuela. People were angry and went to the streets. Many people thought the leader of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, would lose his power.

There were many protests. People said Maduro would fall soon. There was also a failed military uprising. Juan Guaidó tried to remove Maduro. But he did not succeed. Things became quiet again.

But in other countries, the problems were just starting. There were protests and violence in Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador, and Bolivia. In Bolivia, the president, Evo Morales, had to leave his job. The army used violence. Some people thought it was like an ""Arab Spring"" in Latin America.

In Peru, the president closed the congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner came back to politics. In Colombia, many people went to the streets. They did not like the president, Iván Duque.

Even Chile had problems. Chile was usually a stable and rich country. But the price of subway tickets went up. This made people angry. It was the worst unrest in many years. There was a lot of damage. The president of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, had problems too.

Ivan Briscoe works for the International Crisis Group. He is in charge of Latin America. He was surprised by what happened in Chile. He asked, ""Where did that come from?""

A new year was coming. Briscoe said that things were changing very fast in Latin America. There was a lot of uncertainty.","Celso Amorim worked for Brazil in foreign affairs for many years. He reached the highest position. But he says 2019 was a very unusual year for Latin America. ""Like this? Never before,"" he said. He means there was a lot of trouble in many countries.

There were big protests and a failed army revolt. Juan Guaidó tried to remove Maduro, but he did not succeed. Things became calmer, but not for long.

In other countries, there were also many protests and violence. This happened in Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador, and Bolivia. In Bolivia, the president, Evo Morales, had to leave his job. The army used violence against the people. Some people thought this was like a ""Latin American Spring,"" meaning a time of big changes.

In Peru, the president closed the congress. In Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner came back to politics in a surprising way. In Colombia, many people protested against the president, Iván Duque.

Even Chile, which was usually a stable and rich country, had problems. The price of subway tickets went up. This made people very angry, and there were big riots. This was the worst trouble in Chile for many years. There was a lot of damage, and the president, Sebastián Piñera, had problems.

Ivan Briscoe, who works for the International Crisis Group, was surprised by the chaos in Chile. He said he felt like things were changing very fast in Latin America. A new year with more uncertainty was coming.","Celso Amorim worked for Brazil's government for a long time. He had a very important job in foreign affairs.

Juan Guaidó tried to remove Maduro from his position. But he was not successful. The situation became calmer after some time.

However, other countries started having problems too. There were protests and violence in Puerto Rico and Haiti. In Ecuador, people protested a lot. In Bolivia, the president, Evo Morales, had to leave his job. This happened because the military used force.

"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Things have been growing for many years. This includes problems in Chile, Bolivia, and Venezuela. These problems are now becoming clear. We do not know what will happen next.

Someone said that he knows where the problems will be next year. But he does not know what exactly will happen.

Some people on the left in Latin America are happy about this confusion. Amorim said that the problems are a reaction to neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is hurting countries like Colombia and Chile.

He said that it is hard to know what will happen. But things are different now. Eight months ago, it seemed like everything was becoming right-wing. Now, it is not so clear. This is progress, even with all the problems.

Latin America is having a difficult time. But for the left, a difficult time is better than nothing happening.

The year is ending. People are thinking about what will happen next. A report said that there is a high risk of protests spreading. The protests in Colombia were inspired by other countries.

The report said that 2020 will be another difficult year for Latin America. Ecuador will have problems. Amorim agreed that Ecuador is like a powder keg. It could explode again at any time.

Briscoe thinks there will be three problems in 2020. First, Venezuela is getting worse. Second, Brazil and Argentina are having problems because their leaders disagree. Third, Mexico has a lot of murders. The president is trying to stop them. Almost 100 people are killed every day.","Things have been happening for many years. These things are now becoming clear in different places. This includes problems in Chile, Bolivia, and Venezuela. We don't know what will happen next.

Someone said he knows the important problems for next year. But he is not sure what will really happen.

Some people on the left side in Latin America are happy about this confusion. They think this trouble is a reaction from the people. They think the people are fighting against new ideas that are hurting countries like Colombia and Chile.

It is hard to know what will happen next. But things are different now. Before, it seemed like everything was becoming more right-wing. Now, things are not so clear. Even with all the problems, this is a little bit better.

Latin America is having a difficult time. But for the left side, this trouble is better than nothing happening at all.

The year is ending, and people are thinking about what will happen next year. A report says there is a big chance that protests will spread. Protests in Colombia were started by protests in other countries.

The report says that 2020 will be another difficult year for Latin America. Ecuador will have a very hard time. Someone said that Ecuador is like a bomb. It could explode again at any time.

Someone else said that there are three places where problems could start in 2020. First, Venezuela is getting worse with political problems and people needing help. Second, Brazil and Argentina are having problems between their leaders because they have different ideas. Third, Mexico has a big problem with people being killed. Almost 100 people are killed every day. The president is trying to fix this.","Things have been growing for many years. This includes problems like different social classes in Chile. It also includes Evo Morales wanting to stay in power forever in Bolivia. And there is a big fight in Venezuela. Now, these problems are becoming obvious in many places. We do not know what will happen next.

Someone said they know where the problems will be next year. But they do not know exactly what will happen.

Amorim agreed that it is like a bomb waiting to explode. He said Ecuador could explode again at any time.

Someone else, Briscoe, thinks there will be three problem areas in 2020. One is Venezuela, because it is getting worse with politics and people's needs. Another is Brazil and Argentina, because their leaders disagree a lot. The last is Mexico, where the president is trying to stop many murders. Almost 100 people are killed every day there.",0.7353337407112122,0.5,68.38757142857142,1.0,0.6838757142857141,0.6397364849989754,0.74135822057724,0.6666666666666666,69.56125,1.0,0.6956125,0.7012124624146355,0.7969800233840942,0.8,70.5396666666667,0.8615083333333324,0.6638491666666667,0.7536097300169203
"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","In 2014, many people protested in Mexico. This was because 43 students went missing. People were very sad and angry. Briscoe said this could happen again if people kept getting killed.

Briscoe also said there could be problems in Bolivia. This could happen if Luis Fernando Camacho became president. Camacho is very conservative. He might run against someone from Evo Morales' party. Morales' party is leftist.

Briscoe said that many countries could have problems. These countries are Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. He said that people are very unhappy. It is like a ""minefield"" ready to explode. He also said Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile could be dangerous.

Some people think Brazil will have problems too. Lula da Silva used to be the president. He told his supporters to be like Chile and protest against the president. The president of Brazil is Jair Bolsonaro. He is far-right.

Some people think Bolsonaro stopped protests for now. He won the election in 2018. But Monica de Bolle said Brazil could have problems soon. She is an expert on Latin America.

She said people are not protesting right now. But things can change. She thinks that soon, people will see that the economy is not growing. Bolsonaro's support will go down.

This could cause protests like in the past. She talked about the protests in 2013. Those protests helped to remove Dilma Rousseff from power.

Amorim also said Brazil could have problems. People are angry at Bolsonaro because he is not doing a good job.","In 2014, many people in Mexico protested. This happened because 43 students went missing. People were very upset. Someone named Briscoe said this could happen again if the violence did not stop.

Briscoe also thought there would be trouble in Bolivia. This would happen if Luis Fernando Camacho got to the second part of the election. Camacho is very conservative. He would be running against someone from Evo Morales’ party. Morales' party is on the left.

Briscoe said things could be difficult in many countries. He mentioned Colombia, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. He said things could go wrong in these places.

Briscoe said that there is a lot of anger in these societies. He said Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Chile could also have problems.

People have different ideas about Brazil. Brazil has the biggest economy in Latin America. Some people think there might be protests. Lula da Silva used to be the president. He told his supporters to do what people in Chile did. He wanted them to protest against the president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is on the far right.

Some people think that Bolsonaro's election in 2018 stopped people from protesting. They think it let people release their anger without going to the streets, for now.

But Monica de Bolle thinks Brazil could be next. She knows a lot about Latin America. She said that people might not protest right now. But things can change.

She thinks that soon people will see that the economy is not growing. She said this is because Bolsonaro does not have good plans. Then, people might not support Bolsonaro anymore.

She said this could cause problems like in the past. She mentioned the big protests in 2013. These protests led to Dilma Rousseff leaving her job three years later.

"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building. An embassy spokesperson told CNN that the chief of the US mission in Iraq, Matthew Tueller, was away on a scheduled vacation and had left Baghdad a week ago.","People were protesting in Iraq.

Video from the scene showed thick grey smoke engulfing the compound against a backdrop of wailing from an emergency siren. Protesters shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”. By nightfall fires were still burning. One masked man walked off insouciantly with an official US embassy sign. Former foreign service staff compared the chaotic scenes to the ransacking in 1979 of the US embassy in Tehran, which saw 52 US citizens taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.","Here's the text rewritten at a CEFR A2 level:

"A magnitude-5.1 earthquake has struck near Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.","Here is the rewritten text, suitable for CEFR A2 level:

The earthquake was on Friday. It was measured as 5.1. This is a moderate earthquake. It can cause damage.

The earthquake was 53 km from Bushehr. Bushehr is a city with a nuclear facility. It is on the south coast of Iran, near the Persian Gulf.

The earthquake happened at 5:23 in the morning. It was not very deep, only 38 km under the ground.

After the earthquake, people checked for damage. They did not find any damage right away. This is what Iranian television said.

"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts. While noting that all mangalica currently in Romania are recent imports from Hungary, the pig’s history is international, Tóth said.","The mangalica pig is from Hungary. An emperor made this pig a long time ago.

People in Hungary like them again. They are on farms and on dinner tables.

People in other countries also like mangalica. It is popular in the US and Japan.

The meat is fatty and looks like marble. In Japan, they call it “Kobe pork.”

In Hungary, the mangalica is now a national treasure. This means it is very important.

But now, the mangalica faces a new problem. A disease called African swine fever is spreading. It is making many pigs sick.

The mangalica is becoming more popular. This is causing problems with Hungary's neighbors.

"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

A special pig was made in the 1830s. The emperor in Vienna got some pigs from Serbia. These pigs were fat and had long hair.

The emperor crossed these pigs with Hungarian pigs. This happened near Arad. Arad is now in Romania.

A long time ago, many pigs in Hungary were this type. They were called Mangalica. People liked them because they had a lot of fat. The fat could be stored for a long time. It was better than storing meat.

Then, electricity came. People could use refrigerators. They did not need so much pig fat. The Mangalica pig became less common. It became a special, expensive food.

After World War Two, things got bad for the Mangalica. The communist government almost made them disappear. Only 300 pigs were left. They were kept for science. People could not buy the meat.

A young student named Tóth was in Spain. It was the 1990s. He told his Spanish friend about the fat Hungarian pigs. They started a project. They wanted to save the Mangalica.

Tóth put ads in newspapers. He asked people to tell him if they saw a Mangalica pig. He bought all the Mangalica pigs he could find. He bred them with money from Spain.

After some years, they had enough pigs. They sent the fat pork to Spain. People cured the pork there. It was the late 1990s.

Now, there are many Mangalica farmers in Hungary. There are more than 200. You can buy the meat in many markets. It costs more than normal pork. It costs about four times as much.

Zsóka Fekete has a Mangalica farm. It is in eastern Hungary. She says the meat is special. It is different from other meat. The texture is like marble. It tastes unique.

Zsóka used to work in a company in Budapest. In 2012, she went back to her family farm. She bought 20 Mangalica pigs. Now, she has 300.

Many people like her meat. Some are from good restaurants. Some are people in Budapest who love Mangalica. They wait in line to buy her meat. She goes to the city every two weeks.

There is one problem for the Mangalica pig. It is a disease called African swine fever. This disease is a threat.","Here's the text rewritten for CEFR B1 level:

These pigs had a lot of fat. People liked the fat because they could keep it for a long time. It lasted longer than meat.

Later, people started using electricity. They could keep food cold. So, they did not need as much pig fat. The mangalica pigs became more special and expensive.

After the war, things got bad for the mangalica pigs. The communist government almost made them disappear. Only 300 pigs were left. They kept them for science. You could not find the meat anywhere.

A young man named Tóth was studying to be a vet in Spain. He told his Spanish friend about the mangalica pigs. They decided to save them. This was in the 1990s.

Tóth put ads in the newspaper. He said, ""If you see a mangalica, please tell me!"" He bought all the mangalica pigs he could find.

He raised them with money from Spain. After some years, the pigs were ready. They sent the fat pork to Spain to make special food. This was in the late 1990s.

Now, there are many mangalica farmers in Hungary. There are more than 200. You can buy the meat in most markets. It costs more than normal pork. It costs about four times as much.

Zsóka Fekete has a mangalica farm. It is in eastern Hungary. She says the meat is very different.

She says the meat has lines of fat in it. This is especially true in the neck. She says it tastes special.

Zsóka used to work in a big company in Budapest. In 2012, she went back to her family farm. She bought 20 mangalica pigs. Now she has 300.

She sells her meat to many people. She sells to restaurants that are very good. She also sells to people in Budapest who love mangalica meat. People wait in line to buy her meat. She goes to Budapest every two weeks.

There is one problem for the mangalica pigs. It is a disease called African swine fever.","Here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

In the 1830s, someone made a new kind of pig. The emperor in Vienna got some pigs from Serbia. These pigs were fat and had long hair.

The emperor made them breed with Hungarian pigs. This happened near a town. The town is now in Romania.

A long time ago, most pigs in Hungary were this kind. They were called Mangalica pigs. Ninety percent of pigs were Mangalica.

These pigs had a lot of fat. People liked the fat because they could keep it longer than meat. They used the fat for cooking.

Later, people started using electricity. They could keep food cold. So, they did not need as much fat. Mangalica pigs became special and expensive.

After the war, things changed. The government almost destroyed the Mangalica pigs. Only a few pigs were left. About 300 were kept for science. You could not buy the meat anywhere.

A young student was studying animals in Spain. His name was Tóth. He told his friend about the fat Hungarian pigs. They wanted to save the pigs.

Tóth put ads in newspapers. He asked people to tell him if they saw a Mangalica pig. He bought all the Mangalica pigs he could find.

He bred the pigs with money from Spain. After some years, they had enough pigs. They sent the fat pork to Spain. They made special food with it. This was in the late 1990s.

Now, there are many Mangalica farmers in Hungary. More than 200 farmers raise these pigs. You can buy the meat in markets. It costs more than normal pork. It costs about four times as much.

"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","In April, some wild pigs in Hungary got sick. This sickness is a virus. It is very easy to catch.

No farm pigs are sick yet. But if a sick wild pig is found, all pigs nearby must be killed. This is to stop the virus from spreading. The area is about 3 kilometers around the sick pig.

The mangalica pig is in danger. These pigs live outside a lot. New rules are now in place to protect them. There are two fences around the farms. Visitors are not allowed on the farms.

About 1,200 mangalica pigs have been killed. This is more than 10% of all mangalica pigs in Hungary.

The government has a plan to help the mangalica. If things get very bad, they will save the pig's genes. They will also move some important mangalica pigs to safe places. Zoos and universities are safe places.

Many people in Hungary eat pork. They eat it a lot. Some people worry about eating too much meat because of the weather. But this does not change how much pork people eat in Hungary now. Being a vegetarian is not common.

Mr. Tóth says people should eat less meat. This is surprising. He does not like low-quality meat. He does not like how farm animals suffer.

He thinks people should eat less meat. But when they eat meat, it should be good meat. He says one piece of mangalica each week is good.","Here's the rewritten text at a B1 level:

Tóth said the government will help the mangalica pigs if things get worse. They will save the pig's genes. They will move some of the best mangalica pigs to safe places. These places could be zoos or schools.

"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada. I am not excusing the contemporary state for the continuance, but your article is not properly set in the context that actually admits responsibility.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at A2 level, following your instructions:

**About the Protests in India**

People in India are protesting. They are not happy about changes to the citizenship law. This new law is called the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The protests are good. They show that Indian democracy is strong. The people care about their country. Some politicians are not following the rules of the constitution. But the people are speaking up.

The constitution is very important. People talked about it for three years. They made it carefully. They wanted India to be free from British rule. They wanted a fair government.

British rule in India was strange. Britain was a free country. But it ruled India like a boss.

In 1947, India became independent. There was fighting. But India promised to be a good country. It promised freedom and fairness to everyone. This lasted for 70 years.

Now, India has a problem. The new law is causing trouble. It is not fair to everyone. It goes against the ideas of the people who made India. They wanted a country for everyone, not just some people.

**About Colonialism in Canada**

I read your story about police in Canada. They might shoot Indigenous people. This is very bad.

I want you to write about England's role in Canada. England started colonialism in Canada. It took land in 1670. This land was called Rupert's Land. The Hudson Bay Company took things from this land.

Canada is the way it is because of England. England got a lot from Canada's colonialism.

Canada today is still doing bad things. But your story needs to say that England is responsible too. It needs to talk about the history and who started it.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

People in India are protesting. They are protesting because the government changed the rules about who can be a citizen. This new law is called the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The protests are good to see. They show that Indian democracy is still strong. Even though some leaders in the government are not following the rules of the constitution, people are fighting for what they believe in.

The Indian constitution is very important. People talked about it and made it carefully over three years. These people were good at fighting for freedom. They took power from the British government. This was a very special time because it showed that the British were not fair to India.

A man named Henry Maine said that British India was a strange experiment. He said that free people were ruling a country like a king.

India became independent in 1947. There was a lot of fighting at that time. But India promised to be a fair country. It promised to be a country where everyone is equal. For 70 years, India tried to keep this promise.

Now, India has a problem with its constitution. This is because of a new law that was made too quickly. Some people think this law is not fair to everyone. It goes against what the people who made the constitution wanted for India. India is a big and diverse country, and its constitution is very important.

Vinita Damodaran, a professor, wrote about another topic. She talked about the police in Canada. The police were ready to shoot Native people.

She also said that England should take responsibility for what happened in Canada a long time ago. England took land from Native people in 1670. This land was called Rupert's Land. The Hudson Bay Company took things from this land.

England started many problems in Canada. England has gained a lot from taking things from Canada.

Vinita Damodaran said that the current government in Canada is still doing bad things. But she also said that it is important to remember that England started the problems in the first place.","Here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level English:

People in India are protesting. They are unhappy about changes to the citizenship law. This is good because it shows India's democracy is working. The people are speaking up, even though the government is not listening to the constitution.

The constitution was made carefully. People talked about it for three years. These people had fought against British rule. They took power from the British in a good and fair way. This showed how British rule was not right.

Someone named Henry Maine said that British rule in India was strange. He said it was like a free country ruling another country like a dictator.

India became free in 1947. It was a difficult time with fighting. But India promised to be a fair country. It promised freedom and equality for everyone. It kept this promise for 70 years.

Now, India has problems with the constitution. This is because of a new law. This law was made quickly and is based on religion. It goes against what the founders of India wanted for the country. They wanted a country that was fair and diverse.

Vinita Damodaran is a professor. She teaches about South Asian history. She wrote about another article.

The article was about police in Canada. The police were ready to shoot Indigenous people. This is very bad.

She also said that England is responsible for colonialism in Canada. In 1670, England took land called Rupert's Land. They did this easily, without asking. Then, the Hudson Bay Company took resources from this land.

England started everything about how Canada is now. England gained a lot from colonialism in Canada.

She is not saying that Canada today is not responsible. But the article should also mention England's role.

"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia.

Brexit was not good for restaurants. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

The UK money, called the pound, is worth less now. This means food from other countries costs more.

Also, people from Europe were not sure if they could stay in the UK. This made it hard for restaurants to find workers. Many workers from Europe did not want to stay.

The UK has left the European Union in January. But things might not get better for restaurants in 2020.

Restaurant owners say it is hard to keep workers from other countries. These workers are not sure if they want to stay in the UK.

The food industry also has this problem. Many workers in food factories are from Eastern Europe.

If it's hard to keep workers, they might get paid more. This means the food will cost more for customers. So, food prices may go up.

Some scientists are worried about the Earth. They say we need to stop making more meat soon.

People are eating less meat now. For example, a shop called Greggs sells a vegan sausage roll (a sausage roll with no meat).

Next year, more people will cook vegetarian and vegan food. More restaurants will have food without meat on the menu.

Food from Africa might become popular, especially in London.

A restaurant called Chuku’s will open in London. It will sell food from Nigeria.

A chef named William JM Chilila will also open a restaurant. It will have food from West Africa.

**Three People to Watch**

Nisha Katona used to be a lawyer. Now, she cooks Indian food from her family. She has a restaurant called Mowgli.

She started with one restaurant in Liverpool. Now she has ten. She will open four more restaurants in 2020. She has already found places for even more.","**Food and Restaurants**

Brexit has been bad for restaurants. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

The value of the British pound went down. This means things restaurants buy, like food, cost more.

Also, it was not clear if people from other European countries could stay in the UK. This made it hard for restaurants to find workers. Many workers are from Europe.

Now we know the UK will leave at the end of January. But things will probably not get better for restaurants in 2020.

Restaurant owners say it is very hard to keep workers who are not from the UK. These workers wonder if they can stay in the UK in the future.

The same problem exists in the food industry. Many workers in food factories are from Eastern Europe.

When it is hard to keep workers, companies pay them more. This means things cost more, and restaurants will need to raise prices. You can expect food prices to go up in restaurants and stores.

**Climate Change and Food**

Scientists are worried about the climate. They say we need to stop making more meat.

People are already eating less meat. For example, the shop Greggs sells a vegan sausage roll. Vegan means no meat or animal products.

Next year, more people will cook vegetarian and vegan food. More restaurants will offer food without meat.

**New Food Trends**

Food from Africa might become popular, especially in London.

A restaurant called Chuku's will open in London. It will serve food from Nigeria.

Also, a chef named William JM Chilila will open a restaurant. It will be called Akoko. The food will be inspired by West Africa.

**People to Watch**

Nisha Katona is a former lawyer. She decided to cook Indian food. She learned to cook from her family.

The UK left the European Union in January. But things may not get better for restaurants in 2020.

Restaurant owners say it is difficult to keep workers from other countries. These workers wonder if they have a future in the UK.

The food processing business has the same problem. Many of their workers are from Eastern Europe.

When it's hard to keep workers, businesses pay them more. This means food will cost more for customers. So, prices at restaurants and food stores will probably go up.

"Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","**Daniel Humm**

**Climate**

Next year, leaders will meet. They will talk about the climate. The climate is changing. It is a big problem.

The meeting is in Glasgow. It is called UN COP26. They will talk about carbon emissions. Carbon emissions make the Earth warmer.

Scientists say the Earth is already warmer. It is 1.1C warmer than before. By the end of the century, it could be 3C or 4C warmer.

If the Earth gets too warm, bad things will happen. There will be big storms. The sea will rise. There will be deserts. Food will be hard to grow. It will be very hot. People will be in danger.

In 2020, people will talk and plan for the meeting. They want countries to agree to make less carbon emissions.

Rich countries and poor countries do not agree. Poor countries say rich countries made the most carbon emissions. They want rich countries to do more.

Poor countries want money from rich countries. They need money to help with the climate problems. They want $100 billion each year. So far, they have not agreed.","Daniel Humm is a chef from America. He is one of many American chefs who want to be successful in Britain.

He has three stars from Michelin for his restaurant in New York. The restaurant is called Eleven Madison Park.

He just opened a new restaurant in London, at Claridge’s Hotel. The restaurant is called Davies and Brook. It is named after two streets near the hotel.

They want to agree on ways to keep the world from getting too hot. They want the temperature to rise less than 2 degrees Celsius.

Scientists say the world is already warmer than before. It is about 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer. If things don't change, it could be 3 or 4 degrees warmer by the end of the century.

If the world gets too hot, there will be problems. There will be strong storms and rising sea levels. Deserts will grow, and crops will fail. There will also be dangerous heat waves. These things will hurt people around the world.

In 2020, people will work to prepare for the meeting in Glasgow. They will try to get countries to agree to reduce carbon emissions. They also want to help poor countries and rich countries agree on how to fight the climate crisis.

Poor countries say that rich countries made most of the carbon emissions in the past. They say that rich countries are not doing enough to reduce emissions now.

Poor countries want rich countries to give them money. They want at least 100 billion dollars each year. This money will help them deal with the effects of global warming and reduce emissions.

So far, it has been hard to get everyone to agree.","**Daniel Humm**

Boris Johnson says he can secure a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal without having to commit to regulatory alignment with the bloc. The EU suggests it will never agree to this. The Tory leader has further upped the stakes by declaring that the UK will crash out of the transition without a deal if there’s no agreement by the end of the year. Will he really take such a big risk with the British economy, especially its manufacturers and the livelihoods of the voters in the Midlands and the north of England who helped him to a majority? By the end of the year, either his bluff will have been called or he will betray those new Tory voters. There will not be another referendum on independence for Scotland in 2020.

"Current polling suggests that they can’t be confident of winning a referendum now, and a second defeat would surely kill their ambition for a long time. The SNP’s true aim is to stoke Scottish resentment against Westminster to pave the way for a big win in the elections to the Scottish parliament in 2021. That’s the year with the potential for a constitutional car crash that rips apart the kingdom. Both the Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. Most of the attention will be focused on the latter contest, which is expected to climax around March. Expect bitter rows about the election process as the Corbynites who control the party’s national executive committee try to fix the terms of the battle to favour their continuity candidate, Rebecca Long Bailey.

The polls say they may not win a vote now. If they lose again, they will not reach their goal for a long time.

The SNP wants people in Scotland to be angry with the UK government. This will help them win the Scottish parliament elections in 2021. That year could be a bad time for the UK. It could break the UK apart.

Two parties, the Lib Dems and Labour, will get new leaders. Most people will watch the Labour party. The new leader should be chosen around March.

There will be problems about how to choose the leader. Some people in the Labour party will try to help their friend win. Her name is Rebecca Long Bailey.

Some people in Labour think she is like Jeremy Corbyn. They think if she wins, Labour will not win for ten more years.

If that happens, these people may leave Labour. They may try something else.

**Three People to Watch**

*   **Boris Johnson:** He said he would do many things about Brexit, the NHS, and money for the north. Can he do them? Or will he have problems in 2020?

The Lib Dems and Labour will choose new leaders. People will watch the Labour election more. It will probably end in March. There will be many arguments about the election. People who support Corbyn are in charge of the party. They will try to help Rebecca Long Bailey win. She is like Corbyn.

Another Brit film The Dig, about an archaeologist, is also due to put him up on the big screen soon. Nicky Morgan The reappointed culture secretary, now operating from the elevated calm of the House of Lords, will receive pleas from all manner of cash-starved arts schemes, venues and institutes. Will she stay in the job for the long term, and, if so, will she listen? Adele Rumours about the release date for her putative fourth album (30?) are likely to reach fever pitch after a turbulent few years out of the limelight. Royals After a stormy year, the royal family face a challenging 2020 to steady the good ship Monarchy. The Queen, who will be 94 in April, looks increasingly alone as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, leads a near solitary life on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew’s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein’s alleged victims’ lawyers’ relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father.","**Three People to Watch**

"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","Mark Carney is leaving his job at the Bank of England. He talked about companies and money.

He said companies must explain why they invest in oil, gas, and coal. These are called fossil fuels.

He said these investments might become worthless. This means they will have no value.

He spoke on a radio program called Today. Greta Thunberg helped make the program. She cares a lot about climate change.

Carney said the financial world is starting to invest less in oil and gas. But he said it is not fast enough.

Carney will now work for the United Nations. He will work on climate change and money.

He said climate change is a big problem. It is like a sad event coming soon. He said we will have more bad weather.

He said it will be too late if we wait too long. Leaders need to start working on these problems now.

Someone asked if people should stop investing in fossil fuels. Carney said managers of money must decide. They must tell people why they invest in these things.

Someone asked if pension funds should stop investing in oil and gas, even if they make money. Carney said they need to explain why it is okay if the investments become worthless.

He said we cannot burn all the oil and gas. If we do, we cannot stop climate change. Much of the coal, oil, and gas will be useless.

He asked companies, banks, and pension funds what their plans are.

The Bank of England said a lot of money could be lost. This could happen if we do not change to a clean energy economy. The amount is about $20 trillion.","Mark Carney is leaving his job as the head of the Bank of England. He said companies must explain why they still invest in oil, gas, and coal. He thinks these investments could become useless.

He spoke on a radio show called Today. He said that banks are starting to invest less in oil and gas. But he thinks this is not happening fast enough.

After he leaves his job, he will work for the United Nations. He will help with climate change and money. He talked on the radio show with Greta Thunberg. She is trying to make people care about climate change.

Mr. Carney thinks banks must do more to help the world use less carbon. He said climate change is a big problem coming soon. He said there will be more bad weather.

He said it will be too late if we wait until the weather is very bad. Leaders must start working on these problems now.

He was asked if people should stop investing in oil and gas companies. Mr. Carney said that people who manage money must explain their choices. They must explain why they invest in these companies.

He was also asked if pension funds should stop investing in oil and gas. Even if they make money, he thinks they need to explain why. He thinks these investments might become worthless.

He warned that we cannot burn all the oil and gas we have. If we do, we will not be able to stop climate change. He said that most coal and oil may become useless. He asked companies what their plan is. He asked banks, pension funds, and insurance companies too.

After leaving his job, Carney will work with the United Nations. He will help with climate change and money. He spoke on the radio show because Greta Thunberg helped to make the show. Greta Thunberg is someone who works to stop climate change.

Carney has been talking about climate change for a long time. He thinks banks need to do more to stop using fossil fuels. He said that climate change is a big problem coming soon. He said we will have more bad weather.

He said that if we wait for the weather to get really bad, it will be too late. Leaders need to start working on these problems now.

Someone asked Carney if people should stop investing in fossil fuel companies. Carney said that people who manage money must decide. They must explain why they are investing in these companies.

Someone asked if retirement funds should stop investing in oil and gas. This is even if these investments make money. Carney said that these funds need to explain why they are investing. He said some of these investments might become worthless.

He said that we cannot burn all the oil and gas. If we do, we will not reach our goals for stopping climate change. He said that a lot of coal and oil will become useless.

He asked companies, banks, and other groups what their plan is. He wants to know how they will deal with climate change.

"A man who was shot dead in central Moscow after opening fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s main intelligence agency building, in an attack that killed two has been identified as a gun enthusiast. Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man shot someone in Moscow.

"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration.","Austria may have a new government soon. The Green party and the conservative party have made a deal. Sebastian Kurz is the leader of the conservative party. He will probably be the leader of Austria again.

The Green party will be part of the government with Kurz's party. Before, another party was in the government. That party had problems with a scandal. People did not like this party anymore.

Kurz's party and the Green party won the election in September. Kurz's party got the most votes. The Green party got more votes than ever before.

The two parties talked for many months. Now, they have a deal. Kurz said he thinks they can work together well. The leader of the Green party is Werner Kogler. He will probably be the second leader of Austria.

The Green party members need to say yes to the deal. They will vote on Saturday. If they say yes, the new government can start in January.

Other countries are watching Austria. In Switzerland, the Green party is also getting more popular. In Germany, many people like the Green party too.

A German newspaper said the deal in Austria is good. It is a new start for Austria. Two parties that like Europe are working together.

Kurz's party will have the most power in the government. They will be in charge of important jobs like leader and money. They will also be in charge of the police, other countries, and the army.

The Green party will be the smaller party in the government. They will work with Kurz's party, called the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP).

Before, the far-right Freedom party was with the ÖVP. But their leaders had to leave because of a problem called the ""Ibiza affair."" It was about money problems. People did not like this, so they voted for other parties.

The Green party will aim to exercise the most influence through a boosted ministry for infrastructure, transport and environment, expected to be headed by the former climate activist Leonore Gewessler. Green politicians in charge of the justice and culture portfolios will hope to curb the more authoritarian tendencies of Kurz’s ÖVP. In the final stretch of negotiations, Austria’s constitutional court ruled that some of the policies proposed by the conservatives – such as expanded surveillance measures or making social benefits conditional on command of the German language – would violate the constitution. “The Greens’ main aim [during coalition talks] has been to get major concessions on protecting the climate,” said Der Standard newspaper, commenting that the deal with the conservatives was as likely to please environmentalists as to frustrate leftwingers in the party. “With everything else, damage limitation will have to do.”","Susanne Raab will manage it.

"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes.

"Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January. The government has insisted it will push ahead with attempts to unify the French pension system, arguing that removing 42 “special” regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Opéra de Paris staff is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the population ages. While some unions support a single system, almost all reject any age-related changes.

"As the world ushers in 2021, many will be looking forward to putting 2020 behind them. From a cocktail-making contest to a MasterChef-inspired cook-off, the Guardian spoke to four people about their plans for New Year’s Eve. ‘I think he’s making a daiquiri but he’s not very good’ “I’ll be making a raspberry mojito,” said Elinor, speaking of the cocktail-making contest she and her partner, Richard, both 32, have planned for Thursday night. “I think he’s making a daiquiri, but he’s not very good,” she added. Elinor, who works as an engineer in Glasgow, said the idea came to them as they drew suggestions from a hat. Both of them will also be attending an organised online murder mystery event. “We’ve done one before and they work quite well – you go into Zoom rooms to be questioned then come back together and watch the scenes play out,” she said. “In Scotland we have a tradition to ‘first foot’, which means being someone’s first visitor after midnight – normally bearing gifts such as shortbread and whisky. You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick. It’s horrifying at the moment.” ‘We’ve got to be optimistic’ In Preston, Janet and her husband, now both retired, have got together with neighbours every year for the last 18 years for a Christmas party. Coronavirus has prevented them celebrating this year but they are determined to see in 2021 together. In their cul-de-sac, people from five houses are planning to take fire pits and patios – and their drink of choice – to their front gardens at 11.30pm for a safe, socially distanced party.","It is almost 2021. Many people want to forget 2020. 2020 was a hard year for many.

The Guardian newspaper talked to four people. They asked about their New Year's Eve plans.

Elinor and Richard are together. They are both 32 years old. They will have a fun contest on Thursday night. It is a cocktail-making contest.

Elinor said she will make a raspberry mojito. Richard will try to make a daiquiri. Elinor thinks Richard is not good at making daiquiris.

Elinor works in Glasgow. She is an engineer. She said they got the idea from a hat. They wrote ideas on pieces of paper and picked one from the hat.

They will also go to an online event. It is a murder mystery. They did this before. It is fun. You go into Zoom rooms and answer questions. Then you watch the story.

In Scotland, there is a tradition. It is called ""first foot."" It means you are the first visitor after midnight. You bring gifts like shortbread and whisky. You should not leave your house before your first visitor comes.

Elinor is worried about Covid. She wonders how people will do the ""first foot"" tradition safely.

Elinor and Richard were sick the last two years. They had norovirus. This year will be better. They hope people will not get sick. It is bad now.

Janet and her husband live in Preston. They are retired now. They have a Christmas party with their neighbors every year. They have done this for 18 years.

This year, they cannot have the party because of the virus. But they still want to celebrate 2021 together.

People from five houses will have a party outside. They will bring fire pits and chairs. They will also bring their drinks. The party will start at 11:30 pm. They will stay far apart to be safe. They want to be happy and celebrate the new year. They have to be hopeful.","It is almost 2021. Many people want to forget 2020. It was a difficult year.

Elinor and Richard were sick for the last two years. They had norovirus. So this year is better.

Usually, they have drinks at a friend's house. But they hope to stop people from getting sick. It is very bad right now.

"“If all we can do is toast each other and shout across the road, that’s what we’re going to do.” said Janet. “I will bring champagne and my husband will have a glass of red wine.” Janet’s family has been affected by coronavirus during the past year and though her brother recovered from the virus, another relative died. However, she believes it’s important to celebrate what you can. “I just hope everyone else can have a good time in a small way. It’s making the best of what you’ve got and who you’ve got around you.

It’s been a bit disappointing since I arrived in the UK as you always hear that London has a lot of cultural things to offer, but I’ve not been able to experience that yet. I hope next year I’ll be able to see more of the city and that people will be nicer to each other and less toxic. We need to appreciate what we have.” ‘On balance he may be a better cook than me’ Helen, 29, who works in marketing in London said she was “really gunning to win” the MasterChef cook-off she has been preparing for against her boyfriend, Rory, 26. “We’ve been watching the show a lot and started to enjoy cooking more due to lockdown,” she said.","Janet said, ""We will toast each other.

"In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square was mostly deserted. No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. With revelry around the world curtailed by lockdowns and curfews imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, the lions of London’s Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, and there were no crowds in St Peter’s Square and no one diving into the Tiber in Rome. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual. In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy.","In Sydney, fireworks went up in the sky. They were above the Opera House. But the harbour was empty.

In New York, Times Square had few people. Beijing did not have a light show on the TV tower.

Many parties around the world were cancelled. This was because of rules to stop Covid-19.

In London, the lions in Trafalgar Square had barriers around them. There were no crowds in St Peter’s Square. Nobody jumped into the Tiber River in Rome.

"“And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","Angela Merkel spoke about the new year. She said that people have worries. Some people are not sure about the future. But she said that she has hope for the new year.

Merkel is a scientist. People liked how she stopped the first wave of the virus. But now, many people are sick and dying. Some people do not like the rules to stop the virus.

Merkel said she is sad for people who lost family. She is also sad for people who are sick. Some people do not believe in the virus. She said these people are hopeless.

The health minister, Jens Spahn, said the new year will be very quiet.

In France, only six adults can eat together. Many police officers will stop big parties. They will not let people buy alcohol in some places. The police will make sure everyone is home between 8 pm and 6 am. They want to stop big parties and trouble.

In Britain, many people died from the virus. They found a new type of the virus. People who want to have parties must wait. The virus likes big groups of people.

Stephen Powis works for the health service. He said people should stay home. He said this will help stop the virus. It will also help the hospitals. He said it is very important to stay home this year. Do not see other people.

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, told people to follow the rules. He wants people to stay home and be safe.

They put up fences in London. They are in places like Trafalgar Square.

She said we have worries and some doubts. But we also have much hope for the new year. Merkel used to be a physicist. People liked how she handled the virus at first. But now, many are sick and dying. Some people do not agree with the rules about the virus. They protest and believe in wrong ideas about vaccines. Merkel said this is hard for people who lost loved ones. It is also hard for people who are sick. She said it is sad when people deny the virus is real.

In Britain, many people died on Thursday. This is because of a new type of the virus. People who want to celebrate New Year's Eve were told to wait. They should celebrate later in the year. The rule is ""Covid loves a crowd"".

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also said to follow the rules. He said to stay safe at home for the new year.

They put up barriers in public places in London. This includes Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square.

Italy has the most deaths from the virus in Europe. In Italy, bars, restaurants, and most shops are closed. There is a curfew from 10 am to 7 pm on New Year's Eve.","Angela Merkel spoke about the new year. She said that despite problems, she felt hopeful. Some people were worried, and some did not believe in the virus.

Merkel is a scientist. People liked how she handled the first part of the virus problem. But now, many people are sick and dying. Some people do not agree with the rules to stop the virus. They also do not believe the virus is real. Merkel said this is hard for people who have lost loved ones. It is also hard for people who are sick.

The Health Minister, Jens Spahn, said New Year's Eve would be very quiet.

In France, only six adults can be together for dinner. Many police officers will be working. They will stop parties in public places. Some places will not sell alcohol. The police will make sure people stay home between 8 pm and 6 am. This is to stop people from meeting in groups and causing trouble.

"Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility. In New York, the New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway but in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Pope Francis will not lead the New Year's services.

"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","This year was hard for many people. It was also hard for the elephants at Elefanjoy. Elefanjoy is a place in Jaipur, India. It is a safe place for elephants.

In March, there was a big problem. A sickness started. The country closed down. The elephants could not walk. They used to walk 30 miles every day. This helped their legs and their bodies.

Without the walks, the elephants got sick. They also felt sad. The people who worked there felt sad too. Ankit Pareek takes care of the elephants. He said the elephants felt the sadness of the people.

The elephants were sad because there were no tourists. Tourists used to walk with them. They washed them and played with them. They took pictures with them. The elephants missed this.

Ankit was worried. He needed money from tourists. He used the money to feed the elephants. Elephants eat a lot. They can eat 200 kg of food each day. That is like 10% of their weight. It costs 5,000 rupees (£51) for each elephant every day.

Ankit said he did not want the elephants to be hungry. He loves and respects them. He borrowed money to buy food. But if tourists do not come back, it will be a big problem.

Some people say it is not good to use elephants for tourists. They say training elephants is cruel. In India and Thailand, many tourists ride elephants. This makes a lot of money. Now, there are no tourists. This is bad for the elephants.

Some people hope this will stop the problem. They hope elephants will not be used for tourism anymore.

In September, four elephants died. They used to carry tourists. They carried them to a fort in Jaipur. The elephants were tied up all day. They did not have enough food or water. This made them very sick.

"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","COVID-19 has made problems worse. We have talked about these problems for years. Now, elephants are dying.

Mehrotra said there is a big problem. There are only eight places for elephants in India. Most of these places are too small. They cannot take more elephants. Many elephants are ""out of work"" because of COVID-19. They are hungry.

In India, some people own elephants. They have about 1,800 elephants. These elephants help people make money. They are in Hindu festivals and weddings. These events are not happening now because of COVID-19.

The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave money to elephant owners. This money helped during the lockdown. But now, they do not give money anymore. Other states gave no money at all.

In Thailand, people keep elephants in tourist camps. There are 2,000 elephants there. Now, people are leaving the elephants.

The government in Thailand helped a little. They gave grass to the elephants. But some camps had to close.

Many elephants left the camps in Thailand. About 1,000 elephants walked back to their owners' villages. They walked for many days. These villages are where the elephants were born. They had not seen these places for many years.

"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs. Theerapat Trungprakan, the president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association, said the number of callers asking for veterinary assistance had grown since March. Patitta Traiwet, the president of Elephant Jungle Sanctuary, which has branches across Thailand, said she had managed to maintain the animals’ routine but the elephants had noticed the absence of tourists lining up to give them bananas and pineapples. “They were confused at the beginning – where are the people? Why is nobody feeding me banana?” she said. Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth. Many people now hope that even when the tourists return, these elephants will remain resettled in their natural habitat for good.

"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","Here is the rewritten text in CEFR A2 level English:

There is a new type of Covid-19 virus. It is spreading fast in the UK. Scientists think this new type is easier to pass on.

A study helps to prove this idea. The study says this new type has more virus in people's bodies. This means they can give the virus to others more easily.

This new type is called B117. Scientists found it when they looked at why cases were still going up in Kent. This was in November when people could not go out much. The new type kept spreading even when the older types went down.

Some big labs started seeing this new type in samples. These labs help to test for Covid-19. The labs are in cities like London. Then, a group of scientists warned everyone about B117. They said it was easy to pass on.

Dr. Michael Kidd and his team looked at many samples. They took samples from people who felt sick. They found B117 and other types of the virus.

About 35% of people with B117 had a lot of virus in their bodies. Only 10% of people without B117 had a lot of virus. This study is not finished yet. Other scientists need to check it.

Dr. Kidd says it looks like people with B117 have more virus. This can make it easier for them to give it to others. But he also says that we need more information. We need to be sure about this.

Scientists are quite sure that B117 is easier to pass on. Another study says it spreads 56% faster than older types.

We do not know why it spreads faster. Maybe people do not need much virus to give it to others. Maybe the virus grows faster in the body. Or maybe people are sick for a longer time. If people are sick longer, they can give the virus to more people.

Dr. Kidd wants to know how the virus makes so much of itself. He says that we need to do tests in labs. Then we can understand why it is easier to pass on.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death.

"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Here's the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

"A senior manager at the trust, which now has 424 inpatients with Covid, said: “London Gold call has indicated that this position is expected to escalate for the next two weeks with 4 January potentially the zenith of critical care capacity needed.” The Independent Sage committee of scientific and medical experts is urging ministers to instigate an immediate further UK-wide lockdown to try to prevent an imminent “catastrophe”. Any delay will result in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could otherwise have been saved, it said. The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action.

"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

The doctors have hard choices to make. They must decide who can go to the special care unit. They must decide who can only get some care. Some people may not get the best care.

Some patients in special care may not get better. Doctors must decide how long to help them. Other people may need the special care unit. For example, they may need a machine to clean their blood. There are not many machines. Doctors must decide who gets the machine. There are not enough beds and machines for everyone.

Hospitals may stop some other care. This includes surgery for cancer. The NHS said they would try to keep doing these surgeries. But it may not be possible.

The hospital may ask, ""Can we do the cancer surgery today?"" Maybe there are not enough beds. Maybe there is no space in the special care unit for emergencies.

Checking for diseases like cancer may stop. People may wait longer for an ambulance. It may take longer for an ambulance to come when you call 999.

The NHS is having a very hard time. This is the worst time in 72 years. Some hospitals may put up tents outside. Doctors will check patients in the tents.

There are long lines of ambulances outside hospitals. People wait in the ambulances for hours. They are waiting to go into the hospital. On Tuesday, ambulances were waiting outside many hospitals. These hospitals are in London and Birmingham.

Dr. Simon Walsh said they may use tents. He said tents are usually used after a big problem. For example, after a bomb or a big accident.

NHS workers are ready for more people with Covid. The number of people with Covid is growing. It will get worse in the next few weeks.

Dr. Walsh wants the government to make a plan. The plan will help with the problems in the NHS. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid has made the NHS very stressed. This has happened in the last few days.","Here's a rewritten version of the text at a CEFR B1 level:

The doctors will have to make hard choices. For example, they must decide which patients can go to intensive care. Some patients might only get limited care. This means they cannot go to intensive care.

Doctors must also decide how long to treat a patient who is not getting better. If another patient needs a special machine (haemodialysis), and there are not enough machines, they must choose. They also need to choose who gets a bed with a breathing machine (ventilator) if all the beds are full.

Paoloni said that hospitals might have to stop some normal care. This includes cancer surgery. NHS England said they would try to keep this treatment going, but it might not be possible.

A hospital might ask: ""Can we do cancer surgery today? We have few beds. If we use the last bed for cancer surgery, we might not have space for emergencies.""

Checking people for diseases like cancer might also stop. People might wait longer for an ambulance when they call 999.

The NHS is facing a very big problem. It is the biggest problem in 72 years. Some hospitals are thinking about putting up tents outside. They will use these tents to check patients.

There are long lines of ambulances outside many hospitals. The ambulances have patients inside. Some patients wait for hours in the ambulances to get into the hospital.

On Tuesday, ambulances were waiting outside some hospitals. These hospitals include the Royal London Hospital, Queen's Hospital, and Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

Dr. Simon Walsh said that hospitals might use tents. He said this is what they usually do after a big accident, like a bomb attack.

NHS staff are getting ready for more people to come to the hospital with Covid. The number of people with Covid is still going up. Dr. Walsh wants the government to make a plan to help the NHS.

The Doctors' Association UK said that Covid has made things much worse for the NHS. The NHS is under a lot of pressure.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

The doctors will have to make hard choices. They will decide which patients can go to intensive care. Some patients will only get basic care. This means they won't go to intensive care.

Imagine a patient in intensive care who is not getting better. The doctors might have to stop giving them the strongest treatments. This is because another patient might need a haemodialysis machine. But there are not enough machines for everyone. So, the doctors must decide who gets the machine. They also decide who gets a bed with a breathing machine if all the beds are full.

The hospitals might need to stop some other treatments. This could include surgeries for cancer. This is despite promises to keep these treatments going. A hospital might ask: ""Can we do the cancer surgery today?"" They might not have enough beds. They might not have space in intensive care for emergencies. If they use the last bed for cancer surgery, they might not have a bed for an emergency.

It might also be hard to check people for diseases like cancer. People might wait longer for an ambulance to come when they call 999.

The NHS is facing a very big problem. It is the biggest problem in 72 years. Some hospitals are thinking about putting up tents outside. They will use these tents to check patients quickly. There are long lines of ambulances outside many hospitals. The ambulances have patients inside. Sometimes, patients wait for hours in the ambulances before they can go inside the hospital.

On Tuesday, ambulances were waiting in lines outside hospitals. These hospitals included the Royal London hospital and Queen’s hospital in London. Ambulances were also waiting at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.

Dr. Simon Walsh talked about the tent plan. He is a doctor who works in the emergency room. He said using tents is something they usually do after big accidents. For example, they might use them after a terror attack or a big accident at a factory.

NHS workers are getting ready for more patients with COVID. The number of infections is still going up. Dr. Walsh said the government needs a plan to help the NHS. Things are getting very chaotic.

"Throughout the pandemic, technology has been saving our jobs and our sanity – but in Barcelona the lockdowns have led to the revival of one of humanity’s simplest and most enduring inventions: the book. The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","During the pandemic, technology helped us a lot. It helped us with our jobs and made us feel better. But in Barcelona, something else happened. The lockdowns made books popular again.

Bookshops in Barcelona are selling more books now. Even some new bookshops have opened. This is surprising!

One new bookshop is called Llibreria Byron. It opened in November in Sant Antoni. Huygens, a small company that makes books, started it.

Mariana Sarrias is the co-owner of the shop. She said they planned to open in April. But they could not because of the pandemic.

She said they were worried after nine months. They had put a lot of money into the business. They named the shop Byron after a writer. He was romantic and different.

Mariana said many people waited to come in when they opened. There was not enough room for everyone. It was very emotional. People come every day now. She does not know if it is because they want to help, or because the area needed a bookshop.

Maria Carme Ferrer is the president of the book sellers' group in Catalonia. She said people know they need to help their local bookshop now. Bookshops are important places for culture.

Mariana said they saw more orders for books during the lockdown. Maybe people were tired of watching TV. Or maybe they were lonely and books were good friends.

Not long ago, bookshops were in trouble. In 2013, the Catalonia bookshop closed. It was a popular place for readers since 1924. A McDonald’s replaced it.

"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","Maybe this new interest in books is normal. The city is the most important place for books in Spain.

People in Catalonia love books. They have a special day for books on April 23. This is the birthday of Sant Jordi. Sant Jordi is like a special helper for the city. It is also Shakespeare's birthday.

On this day, people give books and roses. The streets have many small shops that sell books.

This year, the virus made Sant Jordi hard to celebrate. Next year, in 2021, it might not be a big party. This is what Lluís Morral says. He works at Laie. Laie is a very popular bookshop.

Morral says that book sales are better now. More people are buying books. They are buying old books, not new ones.

He says, ""People are reading again. They want to read books they wanted to read before.""

""People buy books on Sant Jordi, but they do not read them. Now they see they have many books at home. So they are reading them.""

He agrees that people are reading because they are alone. They see that books are good friends.

Morral says, ""Some people are tired of watching TV.""

Laie and Byron are bookshops with cafes. They have quiet places to read. This is good because the city is very noisy.

Two new bookshops are opening. Ona sells books in Catalan. Finestres will open soon. These shops want people to meet and read there.

Some people are giving money to help these bookshops. Morral hopes they do well. But he knows it is hard to sell books because of Amazon. Amazon is a big online shop.

Morral says, ""We [small bookshops] can help people find the right book. We know what books you like. We can tell you what to read next. A computer on Amazon cannot do that.""","Maybe this quick return to reading is normal. This city is the main place for book selling in Spain. The people of Catalonia love books. They celebrate this love every year on April 23rd. This is the birthday of their special saint, Sant Jordi (Saint George). It is also Shakespeare’s birthday!

On this day, people give books and roses to each other. The streets are full of small book shops. This year, the celebration of Sant Jordi did not happen because of the sickness. Lluís Morral works at Laie. Laie is a popular bookshop in the city. He thinks the celebration will be small in 2021.

Morral says that book sales have gone up during the time when people stayed home. People are buying older, famous books more than new books. He said that many people are reading again. They are not looking for new books. They want to read books they wanted to read before.

He said that many people buy books on Sant Jordi but do not read them. Now, they see the books at home and start reading. He thinks that being alone has helped people find out that books are good friends.

Morral said that many people he knows got tired of watching TV. Laie and Byron are bookshops with cafes. They have quiet places to read. This is good because this city is the loudest city in Europe.

Two new shops are opening. One is called Ona. It only sells books in the Catalan language. The other is called Finestres. It will open soon. Both want to be places where people can meet, read, and buy books. Some people who like to help others gave money to start these shops. Morral hopes they do well.

But he knows it will be hard for them to sell books. They are small shops. They have to compete with Amazon. Amazon is a very big company. Morral said that small bookshops can help people more. They can understand what books you like. They can suggest books you might enjoy. Amazon uses a computer program to suggest books.","Maybe this good news is not surprising.

This year, the celebration could not happen because of the sickness. It will probably be small in 2021 too. This is according to Lluís Morral. He manages Laie, a very popular bookstore in the city.

Morral says that they sold more books when people stayed home. People bought old, famous books more than new, popular ones. He said that many people started reading again.

"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The government of France is in trouble. Some people say they are helping people who do not want the vaccine.

France started giving the vaccine a few days ago. But only a few people have had it.

Health workers say it is like a long race, not a short one. They are going slowly.

Many people in France do not trust the vaccine. About 40% of people want to get the vaccine.

In Britain, 77% of people want the vaccine. In the US, 69% of people want it.

France started giving the vaccine on Sunday. They used the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The first people to get it were people who work and live in care homes. Also, people who could get very sick from the virus got it.

France is the only country that asks people to write down that they agree to get the vaccine. They need to know about the bad things that could happen.

But in the first three days, not many people got the vaccine. Less than 100 people got it.

By Wednesday night, only 332 people had the vaccine. This is what health workers said.

The health workers want to give the vaccine to 1 million old and sick people in January. They need to give more than 31,200 vaccines every day.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said France is giving the vaccine slower than other countries. He said this is on purpose.

He wants to give people information about the vaccine. It is not because they do not have enough vaccines or problems with giving the vaccine.

Véran said they have the same number of vaccines as Germany. They want the same things and will get the same results.

He said it takes time to start. He does not want to go too fast.

The president, Emmanuel Macron, said the vaccine is not a rule. Health workers said they will not make a list of people who do not want the vaccine.

But Macron said people should use their minds and science.

He said the vaccine is not a rule. He said to trust the scientists and doctors.","The government of France is getting some criticism. Some people think the government is trying to please people who do not want vaccines.

The country started giving vaccines a few days ago. But not many people have gotten the vaccine yet.

Health workers in France said that this is a long process, not a quick one. They are going slowly because many people in France are not sure about the vaccine.

Véran said that France has the same amount of vaccines as Germany. He said they have the same goals and will get the same results.

Véran said that it is taking some time to start. He said he wants to be careful and not rush.

The president, Emmanuel Macron, and his ministers said that the vaccine is not required. Government people said that they will not make a list of people who do not want to get the vaccine.

France started giving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday. They started with workers and people living in care homes. They also gave it to people who are likely to get very sick from the virus.

France is different from other countries. They want people to write down that they agree to get the vaccine. This is after they learn about possible problems with the vaccine.

But in the first three days, less than 100 people got the vaccine. By Wednesday evening, health officials said only 332 people had gotten the vaccine.

The health ministry said they want to give the vaccine to 1 million old and at-risk people in January. This means they need to give more than 31,200 vaccines every day.

The health minister, Olivier Véran, said France is giving vaccines slower than other countries. He said this is on purpose. He wants to give people information about the vaccine first. It is not because they don't have enough vaccines or because there are problems with getting the vaccines to people.

Véran said they have the same number of vaccines as Germany. He said they have the same goals and will get the same results.

Véran said it is taking some time to start. He also said that being fast is not the same as being rushed.

The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, and his ministers said the vaccine will not be required. Officials said they will not make a list of people who do not want the vaccine.

But Macron said people should listen to ""reason and science.""

Macron said the vaccine is not required. He said people should trust the scientists and doctors.",0.7944912314414978,0.5,85.51731048121295,1.0,0.8551731048121294,0.7165547787512091,0.7672072052955627,0.6666666666666666,77.43263106796117,0.9391842233009708,0.7560815776699029,0.7299851498773774,0.8052593469619751,0.8,77.43286138613863,0.7,0.6843286138613862,0.7631959869411205
"In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign. Axel Kahn, a leading geneticist and head of the National League Against Cancer, told Europe 1 radio that France’s vaccine strategy was wrong. “It is not suited to a situation that is so dangerous,” he said. Philippe Juvin, head of the casualty ward at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris, agreed. “As an individual, I would like to be vaccinated to set an example and show people that we don’t die from the vaccine, we die from Covid. And when we don’t die, we can get severe forms of it that are very disabling,” Juvin told CNews television. Opposition leaders said the slowness of the vaccination programme made France the “dunce” of Europe. Damien Abad, leader of the centre-right opposition Les Républicains in the Assemblée Nationale, demanded an urgent meeting with the health minister. In a letter, other opposition critics wrote: “Mass vaccination is the ultimate means of seeing our country emerge from the damaging economic situation caused by the health crisis. Yet France is vaccinating 10,000 times slower than the UK.” They added: “France cannot be one of the last countries to get vaccinated and yet that’s the picture we’re facing today.” Alain Fischer, the government official overseeing France’s vaccination programme, told Europe 1 the country had chosen to prioritise the elderly and vulnerable, as opposed to health professionals, as in other countries. “There is no good or bad choice … These are small details that will seem ridiculous in two or three months,” he said. Critics say this hesitation is feeding conspiracy theories and anti-vaxxer sentiment. Nathan Peiffer-Smadja, an infection specialist at Paris’s Bichat hospital, said the scientific data was clear. “The vaccine is safe and efficient. Like many of my colleagues, I think we should be giving the vaccines quicker in order to control the epidemic more rapidly. At the rate we’re going, we’ll still be in lockdown in 2022,” he tweeted.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at an A2 level:

"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Here's the rewritten text, following your instructions for A2 level English:

**Monkeys in Gibraltar and Coronavirus**

In Gibraltar, people are checking on the monkeys every day. These monkeys are called Barbary macaques. People are worried that the monkeys could get sick from the coronavirus.

Gibraltar is a British place. Not many people there got the virus. About 1,500 people got sick, and six people died.

Many countries are trying to stop the coronavirus. In Gibraltar, people have another worry. They want to protect the monkeys from the virus. These monkeys are the only wild monkeys in Europe.

Mark Pizarro takes care of the monkeys. He said, ""We knew this could happen. The virus lives in people like us. So, it can be dangerous for other monkeys too.""

Earlier this year, the government made new rules. They wanted people to stay away from the monkeys. Many tourists like to see the monkeys.

In August, the government made a new law. It is now against the law to touch or bother the monkeys. It was already against the law to give them food. People can get big fines if they break these rules.

The government said, ""Monkeys can get sick from human diseases. In the past, our monkeys got hepatitis A.""

The monkeys have lived in Gibraltar for a long time. Some people say that as long as the monkeys are there, Gibraltar will stay British.

Sometimes, people do a lot to protect the monkeys. During the war, Winston Churchill helped get more monkeys from Africa. He wanted to keep the monkey population strong.

Now, there are about 220 monkeys.

Recently, four monkeys died. They died because of other things, like cars. People tested them for the coronavirus. The tests were negative. This makes the government think the virus is not a big danger to the monkeys.

"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal. They interact with themselves, they forage naturally, they spend more time grooming each other, there’s less aggression between the macaques,” said Pizarro. “So there is a lot of positive spin from decreased human contact.”","The government in Gibraltar is worried.

"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus.","Jonathan Pollard is in Israel now.

"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate. Last week a judge awarded her £31,000 in compensation after she sued L&amp;Q for negligence. The Observer had also reported the case of another black tenant who has spent two years in a women’s refuge after fleeing an abusive ex-partner. L&amp;Q failed to rehouse her without concrete evidence that she was endangered. “These are not isolated cases,” said the Labour peer Lord Filkin. “Board members and managers have a fundamental duty to ensure that tenants can live peacefully in their homes; there is more they need to do to ensure this duty is fulfilled.” L&amp;Q, which houses 250,000 people in more than 105,000 homes across the south-east, has promised an independent review on how it handles abuse cases following the Observer investigation. In a statement on its website it admitted that there were lessons to be learned and said that it has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination of any kind. The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said that it would be glad to meet the letter’s signatories to discuss reforms. “We know that as a sector we can and must do better,” said chief executive Kate Henderson.","People are asking for changes in social housing.

Her housing group, London and Quadrant (L&Q), did not evict the people who threatened her. They also did not give Laura a new home.

A court said L&Q was wrong. They gave Laura £31,000 because L&Q did not help her.

L&Q did not give her a new home because they said she needed to prove she was in danger.

""The Observer"" also wrote about another black woman. She lived in a safe house for two years. She ran away from her ex-partner who was hurting her. L&Q did not give her a new home because they said she did not have enough proof that she was in danger.

"The ruthless campaign by the Chinese government to extinguish all memories of the massacre at Tiananmen Square has now resulted in the removal of the sculpture from the campus of the University of Hong Kong (Outcry as memorial to Tiananmen Square victims removed from Hong Kong University, 23 December). Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic.

"Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","Some people were protesting against vaccines.

"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","Mudassar Kadir used to work for the BBC in Afghanistan. The Taliban took over Afghanistan. He had to leave the country.

He is now in a refugee camp. He has been there for many months. The UK government promised to help him move to a new country. But it is taking a long time.

Mudassar is the only one who escaped from 14 former BBC workers. The other 13 are still hiding. They are afraid for their lives.

Mudassar also worked for the World Bank. He also worked for the old government of Afghanistan. He wanted a new life for his family.

He left Afghanistan in October. A charity from the US helped him. He is now in a refugee center near Dubai with his wife and two sons.

The United Arab Emirates is helping them. They are safe there. But they cannot leave the area. The UAE will not give them asylum.

Mudassar is angry. The UK government will not help him. He is afraid of going back to Afghanistan. The Taliban are angry at him because he worked for the BBC.

He said the UK should help him and his family. His life is in danger because he worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this, but they are not helping.

He hoped the UK would give him a visa. But now he is very frustrated. Every day, he feels worse.

Other people are in the same situation. They cannot go home. They are afraid of being hurt. They cannot go to a new country. No country will take them as refugees.

The UK promised a plan to help Afghan people. The plan is called the Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme (ACRS). It will help 5,000 people each year. It will start in January. There is another plan called Arap. But it is more difficult.

Mudassar cannot use the Arap plan. It has only helped less than 400 people. He cannot use the ACRS plan yet. It is not open. When it opens, only some organizations can ask for help for people.

"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office does not agree with this.

"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","The new year is coming. The world has many big problems.

Covid-19 is still a problem. The weather is also a big problem. It is called climate change.

Some countries are free, and some are not. This is a fight between democracy and authoritarianism.

People have problems with food and safety. Many people are moving to new countries. There is also danger from terrorists.

Countries might fight each other. The rules that keep countries safe are not working well. There are new weapons that can kill people without humans controlling them.

So, 2022 will be a difficult year for many people.

The Middle East will be in the news a lot this year. Some news will be good, and some will be bad.

One good thing is the World Cup. It is a soccer game. It will be in Qatar in November. Qatar is an Arab and Muslim country. This is the first time a country like this will have the World Cup.

This could help business and tourism in the Gulf area. Maybe the governments will become more open and fair.

But some people are not happy about Qatar hosting the World Cup. Some people think there was cheating involved in choosing Qatar. Also, Qatar has problems with human rights.

Qatar treats workers from other countries badly. Many workers have died building stadiums and other things for the World Cup.

People are also worried about freedom of speech in Qatar. It is not safe to criticize the government. It is also not safe to be gay in Qatar.

But some people think that most soccer fans will not worry about these things. This could make the World Cup in Qatar a good way for Qatar to look better than it is. This is called ""sports-washing.""

Other things will also be important in the Middle East. One big question is about Iran.

Iran wants to make nuclear weapons. But Iran says this is not true. Israel and the United States do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons.

Israel might attack Iran. This could happen if talks about Iran's nuclear program do not work.

Even soccer fans will notice if there is a war in the Gulf.","The new year is coming, and the world has many problems. These problems include:

*   Covid-19 is still a problem.
*   The weather is changing a lot, and it's dangerous.
*   Some countries are democracies, and some are not. They are arguing.
*   Many people need help with food and shelter.
*   Lots of people are moving to new countries.
*   Terrorism is still a problem in the world.

Also, countries might start fighting each other. It is hard to follow the rules of the world now. There are also new weapons that can decide to kill people by themselves. So, for most people on Earth, the next year might be dangerous.

**Middle East**

Things that happen in the Middle East will be in the news again next year. Some news will be good, and some will be bad.

One good thing is the World Cup soccer game. It starts in Qatar in November. This is the first time a Muslim country has the World Cup. This could help business and tourism in that area. Maybe the government will become more open too.

But some people think it was not a good idea to choose Qatar. Some people said there was cheating. Also, they do not treat people very well. Many workers from other countries work for little money. Many of these workers died while building new things for the World Cup.

People are also worried about free speech in Qatar. It is not safe to say bad things about the government. It is also not okay to be gay in Qatar.

But some people think that fans will not think about these problems. They will just watch the games. This could make Qatar look good, even if it is not.

Other problems will also be in the news from the Middle East. One big problem is Iran. Some people think Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons. Iran says this is not true. Israel may attack Iran if the talks do not work. Even soccer fans will notice if there is a war in the Middle East.","The new year is coming, but the world has many big problems. These problems include:

*   The Covid-19 virus is spreading again.
*   The climate is changing in dangerous ways.
*   There is a fight between countries with democracy and countries with strong leaders.
*   Many people need help because of bad situations.
*   Many people are moving from their homes.
*   Terrorists are attacking in different countries.

There is also a chance of new wars between countries. It is harder for countries to work together. New weapons that can decide to attack on their own are also a danger.

So, for most people, 2022 will be another year with risks.

**Events in the Middle East**

Things happening in the Middle East will be important news in 2022. Some of this news will be good, and some will be bad.

One good thing is the World Cup in Qatar in November. It is the first time a country in the Arab world has the tournament. This could help the area get more business and visitors. It might also lead to better ways of running the country.

But some people are not happy about Qatar hosting the World Cup. They say there was unfairness in choosing Qatar. They will also watch how Qatar treats people.

Qatar’s treatment of workers who are paid very little is a problem. A newspaper said that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar was chosen in 2010. They died while building stadiums, roads, hotels, and an airport.

People are also worried about Qatar not allowing free speech. They also worry about the rights of women and people who are LGBTQ+. It is dangerous to speak against the government in Qatar. Homosexuality is against the law.

But some experts think that most football fans will not think about these problems. If this is true, the World Cup in Qatar could be a good example of “sports-washing.” This means using sports to make a country look better than it is.

Other problems will still be important in the Middle East. One big question is: Will Israel or the United States do anything to stop Iran from making nuclear weapons? Iran says it is not trying to make nuclear weapons. Israel has said it might attack Iran if talks about the 2015 nuclear agreement fail.

"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

**Turkey**

People will watch Turkey. The president of Turkey is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Some people think he is a strong leader. His party, AKP, has been in power for 20 years.

Some people say Erdoğan is becoming too strict. He argues with the EU and the US. He sometimes works with Russia about Syria. Turkey's economy is not doing well. This could cause problems.

**Lebanon and Libya**

Lebanon may have big problems. It could become like Yemen, a country with a war. Libya is also a country with many problems. People should watch these countries.

**Palestine**

People should also watch Palestine. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, did not have elections. Some people from Israel are taking land in the West Bank. There is no peace process. These are big problems.

**Asia Pacific: China**

The world will watch China. This will happen at the start and end of the year. Maybe during the year too.

The Winter Olympics are in Beijing in February. People want to see who wins the most medals. But some countries like the US and UK will not send important people. They do not like China's human rights record. They think China will use the Olympics to show off.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will have a meeting later in the year. President Xi Jinping wants to stay in power for five more years. This would be his third time. He would be the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

People will try to get important jobs in the CCP. It may not be easy for Xi. China's economy is slowing down. China has a lot of debt. The population is getting older. There are problems with the environment. The US is trying to stop China from getting too strong.

But China will likely try to become more important in the world. They will try to have more economic and political power. This is likely to happen in 2022.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

**Turkey**

People will watch Turkey and its leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He is a powerful president. His party, AKP, has been in power for 20 years in 2022. Erdoğan is becoming more strict in Turkey. He also has a strong foreign policy. He has problems with the EU and the US. He sometimes works with Russia about Syria. He also has problems with the economy. This could cause problems in the future.

**Lebanon and Libya**

Lebanon is in trouble. It might become a failed country, like Yemen, where there is war. Libya is always chaotic. People should also watch these countries.

**Palestine**

Palestine is also important. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is not popular. He stopped elections from happening. There is violence from Israeli settlers. People are taking land in the West Bank. There is no peace process happening. These things are big problems.

**Asia Pacific: China**

The world will watch China a lot this year. The Winter Olympics will be in Beijing in February. Many people like sports. But the Olympics might not be just about sports. The US, UK, and other countries are not happy with China. They say China treats people badly. They might not send important people to the Olympics. They think China will use the Olympics to show how good it is.

Later in the year, China will have an important meeting. It is the Chinese Communist Party's 20th national congress. The leader, Xi Jinping, wants to stay in power for five more years. This would be his third time. If this happens, he will be the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong. People will also try to get important jobs in the government.

Not everything might go as Xi Jinping wants. Some people think he is strong. Other people are not so sure. The economy is not growing fast. China has a lot of debt. The population is getting older. There are big problems with the environment. The US is trying to stop China from getting too powerful. The US is working with countries near China. All of this is making things difficult for Xi Jinping.

But in 2022, China will probably keep trying to be more powerful in the world. China wants to have more economic and political power.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level, focusing on simple language and clarity:

**Turkey**

People will watch Turkey closely. The president of Turkey is Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He is seen as a leader who does not allow much freedom. His political party, AKP, has been in power for 20 years in 2022.

Erdoğan has become stricter in his own country. He also has a strong foreign policy. He has had problems with the EU and the US. He sometimes works with Russia about Syria. His poor handling of the economy could cause problems.

**Other Problem Areas**

Lebanon is in danger. It could become like Yemen, a country ruined by war. Libya is also very unstable.

Palestine also needs attention. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is not popular. He has delayed elections. There is violence from Israeli settlers. They are taking land in the West Bank. There is no progress in peace talks.

**Asia Pacific**

The world will watch China closely all year.

The Winter Olympics will be in Beijing in February. Many people will watch the sports. But some countries like the US and UK will not send officials. This is because they are protesting China's human rights issues. They think China will use the games to show its power.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will have a big meeting later in the year. This is called the 20th national congress. President Xi Jinping wants to stay in power for another five years. This would be his third term. If he gets it, he will be the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

There will be competition for important positions in the government. It might not all go as Xi wants.

Experts disagree about how strong Xi's position really is. China's economy is growing slower. It has a lot of debt. The population is getting older. There are big problems with the environment and climate change. The US is trying to limit China's power by working with other countries. All these things put pressure on Xi.

However, in 2022, China will likely continue to try to increase its power around the world. It will try to grow its economy and influence other countries.",0.7309756278991699,0.5,76.6068855421687,1.0,0.766068855421687,0.6656814944402857,0.7769734263420105,0.6666666666666666,72.37948179979779,1.0,0.7237948179979778,0.722478303668885,0.7311100959777832,0.6,70.23366483516484,0.8691583791208789,0.6630841620879121,0.6647314193552317
"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister.","A war in Taiwan would change many things. China wants to take Taiwan back. China's leader, Xi, said he will do it. He will do it in any way he can.

India is China's biggest competitor in the area. India might become more important in the world. Soon, India might have as many people as China. China has 1.41 billion people.

But, Indian families are getting smaller. Also, India and China have problems with their border in the Himalayas. They had fights in 2020 and 2021. This shows that they do not have good relations.

Narendra Modi is the leader of India. He is becoming less popular. This is because of the sickness and the slow economy. He had to change his plan about farms. People say he uses laws about terrorists to stop people from criticizing him. His party will try to win elections in 2022.

Modi wants India to be friends with countries in the West. He is part of the Quad group. This group includes India, the USA, Japan, and Australia. This makes China unhappy.

In Myanmar, the government is hurting people. In Afghanistan, people are suffering after the Taliban took over. Western countries will worry about it. But they might not do much to help. Afghanistan is close to a disaster.

David Beasley works for the World Food Programme. He said that 23 million people will not have food. He said that the next six months will be very bad.

North Korea has nuclear weapons. Kim Jong-un is the leader of North Korea. He acts like he might start a war. He also acts like he wants peace.

The Philippines will choose a new president. The current president, Rodrigo Duterte, can only be president for one term.

Scott Morrison is the leader of Australia. He wants to be the leader again.","A war with Taiwan could change everything. China wants to take Taiwan back, even by force.

India is a big rival to China. India may become as big as China soon. Some people think India will have as many people as China's 1.41 billion. But, Indian families are getting smaller.

India and China have problems with their border in the mountains. They fought in 2020 and 2021. This shows their relationship is getting worse.

Narendra Modi is the leader of India. He is becoming less popular because of the sickness and money problems. He had to change a plan about farms. People say he uses laws about terrorists to stop people who disagree with him. His party will try to win elections in 2022.

In Myanmar, the government is hurting people. In Afghanistan, people are suffering after the Taliban took over. Rich countries will probably worry, but not do much to help. Afghanistan is in big trouble.

David Beasley says that 23 million people may starve in Afghanistan. He works for the World Food Programme. He says the next six months will be very bad.

North Korea has nuclear weapons. The leader, Kim Jong-un, is making threats. He may start a war.

The Philippines will have a new leader. The old leader, Rodrigo Duterte, can only be leader for one term.

Scott Morrison wants to be the leader of Australia again.","A war over Taiwan could change a lot. China's leader, Xi, wants to take back Taiwan. He said he might use any way to do it.

"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine.","Europe

This year is important for Europe. The leaders of Europe must deal with problems. Some problems are inside Europe. Some problems are outside Europe.

The pandemic is still here. It is making life hard for people and the economy. There are also problems with people moving to Europe.

After the COP26 meeting, Europe wants to stop using fuels that pollute the air. This is a new challenge.

Europe needs to decide what it wants to be. Does it want to be a strong country in the world? Or will it let China, the US, and Russia have more power?

The elections in France and Hungary will be important. These elections are in the spring. Some people in these countries want to divide people. They have strong opinions.

Viktor Orbán is the leader of Hungary. He is not following the rules of the EU. He does not respect democracy or free speech. Now, other parties are joining together to try to defeat him in the election. People in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other countries are watching this closely. These countries also have parties with strong opinions.

Emmanuel Macron is the leader of France. He wants to be the leader for another term. He will run against Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Some people say these two are racist.

Polls say that Macron is ahead. But Valérie Pécresse might also challenge him. She is the first woman to lead the Republican party.

The left party in France is not strong. The election could make France more conservative.

There will also be elections in Sweden, Serbia, and Austria.

Germany has a new government. It is led by the SPD party. People will watch to see if this government does things differently. Angela Merkel was the leader of Germany for a long time.

The new government might have problems with the European Commission. Ursula von der Leyen leads the European Commission. She is friends with Angela Merkel. Germany might also have problems with France and other countries about money.

France will lead the EU in January. Macron wants to talk about defense and security. He wants Europe to be strong and independent.

Macron thinks Europe needs to protect itself. This will be tested in many places, like Ukraine.","Europe will have a very important year. The EU and leaders of countries must deal with problems inside and outside of Europe.

The pandemic is still here. It affects people and the economy. There are also problems with people moving to Europe. New rules about pollution are also making things difficult. These rules are about stopping pollution by a certain date.

Europe needs to decide what it wants. Does it want other countries to respect it? Or will it let China, the US, and Russia have more power?

Important elections will happen in France and Hungary in the spring. In these countries, some groups want to make people fight.

Viktor Orbán is the leader of Hungary. Some people think he is not fair. He does not always follow the rules of the EU about law, freedom, and saying what you think. For the first time, people who disagree with him are working together. People in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and other countries are watching this. They have similar groups in their countries.

Emmanuel Macron is the leader of France. He wants people in France to vote for him again. He is against people who do not like people from other countries or religions, like Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Some polls say he will win. But he might also have a hard time with another person called Valérie Pécresse. She is the first woman to lead a big group in France. Some people think the left is not strong. So, the election could make France more against new ideas.

There will also be elections in Sweden, Serbia and Austria.

Germany has a new government. People will watch it closely to see if it does things differently after Angela Merkel. There might be problems between Germany and the EU. Ursula von der Leyen leads the EU. She is a friend of Angela Merkel. There might also be problems with France and other countries about money.

France will lead the EU in January. Macron will try to make Europe work together on safety. He thinks Europe should be able to protect itself. This idea will be tested in places like Ukraine.","Europe: A Difficult Year

This year will be very important for Europe. Leaders in the EU and in countries will face many problems. These problems include disagreements inside and outside Europe. The pandemic is still causing problems for people and the economy. Migration is also a challenge.

After the COP26 meeting, countries promised to have zero emissions. This is a new challenge for Europe.

Europe needs to decide what it wants to be in the world. Does it want to be important? Or will it let China, the US, and countries like Russia have more power? Russia is led by Vladimir Putin.

The elections in France and Hungary in the spring will be important. Right-wing groups are pushing ideas that divide people.

Viktor Orbán is the leader of Hungary. He has not followed the rules about law, democracy, and free speech. Now, for the first time, he will face a group that is against him.

"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world.","Here's the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level:

Some people think Russia will make more problems. They are moving many soldiers near the border. Russia said they might use nuclear weapons. This could start a new war soon. NATO might not help.

Other problems could start a war too. Belarus is using people who want to move to Europe as a weapon. Europe does not have a good plan to help these people. There are also problems in Bosnia and other places in the Balkans. People there want to break away from their countries.

The EU will meet with China. They need to decide how to do business with China and still care about human rights. It is hard to do both.

Britain is not doing well. They are poor and alone. People are sorry they voted to leave the EU. This will get worse.

The USA does not like Europe being independent. The USA is not sure what to do about Ukraine. This could make problems between the USA and Europe.

NATO is not seen as strong after what happened in Afghanistan. They need a new leader. It will be hard to find someone. Some people think a woman might be the new leader. Theresa May, who used to be the leader of Britain, is a possibility. But France does not want someone from Britain.

Many people in Brazil are angry with Bolsonaro. He did not handle the COVID-19 pandemic well. Many people died. Only the USA had more deaths.

Bolsonaro does not care about climate change. He is letting people destroy the Amazon rainforest. Many people are angry about this.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva used to be the president. He was in jail, but now he is free. People think he could beat Bolsonaro in the election.

The European Union (EU) will talk to China. They need to decide how to do business with China and protect human rights. It is hard to find a good balance.

Britain is having problems after leaving the EU (Brexit). Many people are not happy with Brexit now. Britain is also becoming poorer.

Britain's relationship with the United States (US) might be difficult. The US does not like Europe being too independent. The US is not sure what to do about Ukraine.

"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","In Europe, many people do not support right-wing politicians now. But in South America and other poor countries, it might be different in 2022.

Populism happens when there is a big difference between rich people and poor people. In many poor countries, this difference is getting bigger.

In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who said they would help the people are now hurting them. This is likely to continue.

In Chile, there was an election. José Antonio Kast got many votes at first. He supported Pinochet, a leader from the past. But Gabriel Boric won the election. He is a young, left-wing leader. He will be the youngest leader of Chile.

In Argentina, the president is Alberto Fernández. He will have a hard time this year. His party lost control of the Congress. This is the first time in 40 years.

In Mexico, the president is Andrés Manuel López Obrador. He will have problems with the USA. They will argue about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But at least Trump is not president anymore.

In North America, everyone will watch the elections in November. The Democrats will try to keep control of the Senate and House. The results will show what people think about Joe Biden, the president.

If the Republican party wins, Donald Trump might run for president again in 2024. He still says he won the election in 2020, but that is not true.

Some important problems are:

*   The pandemic: Will it get better or worse?
*   The economy: Prices are going up.
*   Social issues: People disagree about moving to the country, race, and abortion. The Supreme Court might change the rules about abortion.","In Europe, some people think right-wing leaders are becoming less popular. But this might not be true in South America, except for Brazil. It might also not be true in other poorer countries in 2022.

Populism happens when there is a big difference between rich leaders and normal people. In many poor countries, this difference is getting bigger. The rich have more money and power.

In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who said they would help people are now hurting them. This may continue to happen.

In Chile, the first election was good for José Antonio Kast. He is a very right-wing person who supported Pinochet. But he lost the final election to Gabriel Boric. Boric is a left-wing leader who used to be a student. He will be the youngest leader of Chile.

In Argentina, the president, Alberto Fernández, will have a difficult year. His party, called the Peronists, lost power in Congress. This is the first time in 40 years.

In Mexico, the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will have problems with the United States. They will disagree about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But at least he does not have to deal with insults from Trump anymore.

In North America, everyone will watch the elections in November. The Democrats will try to keep control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Republicans want to win them back.

The election results will show how people feel about Joe Biden, the president. If the Republicans do well, Donald Trump might try to become president again in 2024. He still says he won the 2020 election, but this is not true.

Some important problems will affect the whole country. These problems are:

*   The virus: Will the virus get better or worse? Some people still do not want to get shots.
*   The economy: Prices and interest rates will probably go up.
*   Social issues: People disagree about people moving to the country, race, and abortion. The Supreme Court might change the rules about abortion.","Here is the text rewritten in simple English, suitable for a B2 level learner:

Some studies in Europe show that fewer people support right-wing politicians. But this might not be true in South America, except for Brazil. It may also not be true in other developing countries in 2022.

Populism happens when there is a big difference between rich leaders and regular people. In many poorer countries, this difference is getting bigger. This is about money and power.

In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela, leaders who said they would help people have become bad rulers. This problem may continue.

In Chile, there was an election. José Antonio Kast got a lot of support in the first part of the election. He was a politician on the right and liked Pinochet, a former leader. But he lost to Gabriel Boric. Boric is a leftist. He used to be a student leader. He won the election and will be the youngest leader of Chile.

Argentina's president, Alberto Fernández, has problems. It looks like the next year will be hard. His political party, the Peronists, lost in the elections. This party is very old. They lost control of Congress for the first time in 40 years.

Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will have problems with the US. These problems are about trade, drugs, and people moving from Central America. But at least he does not have to deal with insults from Trump anymore, for now.

In North America, everyone will watch the elections in November. The Democrats will try to stop the Republicans from taking control of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The results of these elections will show what people think of Joe Biden, the president. If the Republicans do well, Donald Trump might run for president again in 2024. He still says he won the 2020 election, but this is not true.

Some issues are important all over the country. These are: how well we are dealing with the pandemic, people who don't want to get vaccinated, the economy, prices and interest rates going up, and social issues like immigration, race, and abortion. The Supreme Court might change the Roe v Wade decision from 1973, which protects abortion rights. They might make it weaker.",0.8934251666069031,0.5,66.07645161290324,1.0,0.6607645161290324,0.6847298942453118,0.8734678030014038,0.6666666666666666,65.51194697042214,1.0,0.6551194697042214,0.7317513131240972,0.8366416692733765,0.0,65.08375000000001,0.9979062499999998,0.650209375,0.49561701475779213
"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

**Democrats in 2022**

The Democrats have a problem. The problem is inside their own party. There are two groups: progressives and moderates. They disagree a lot.

This disagreement made it hard for Biden to pass his big plans. He wanted to spend money on social care and roads. But these plans were changed a lot because of the disagreement.

People are watching Biden. Will he run for president again in 2024? He will be 80 years old soon. Some people wonder if he is too old. They also wonder if he can do his job well. Many people do not like him right now. It may be hard to change their minds.

Kamala Harris is the Vice-President. People are also watching her. Some people say she is not happy. They say she is not doing a good job. Maybe these people want to cause problems for Biden.

Pete Buttigieg is in charge of transportation. He wanted to be president in 2020. People are watching him too. He might replace Harris or even Biden. Maybe Biden will only be president for four years.

Some people are worried about the elections. The elections are in the middle of Biden's time as president. Some Republicans are trying to make it harder to vote. They are also changing the voting areas. This will help Republicans win. One study says Republicans will win more seats because of this. This could mean Republicans will control the House of Representatives.

Many people from Central America want to come to the US. They are trying to cross the border. This is a problem for the US. Harris is in charge of this problem. But she has not done well so far. People say she and Biden are using the same bad rules as Trump.

People do not trust Biden as much now. This is because of what happened in Afghanistan. The US left Afghanistan quickly. It looked like a big failure.

Something bad could happen in another country. Russia could take land in Ukraine. China could attack Taiwan. Israel and Iran could fight. If something like this happens, the US could get involved. This could make Biden's presidency even harder.

**Canada**

Justin Trudeau is the leader of Canada. He won the election again. He wants to make childcare and houses cheaper. He will try to do this soon.","The Democrats have a big problem in 2022. They don't agree with each other. There are two groups: progressives and moderates. They disagree in the Senate. This made Biden's plans for social care and roads weaker. The plans cost a lot of money.

People will watch Biden. Will he run for president again in 2024? He will be 80 years old in November. Can he still think clearly? Can he do what he wants to do? In December, many people did not like Biden. It may be hard to change their minds.

Kamala Harris is the vice-president. People are also watching her. Some people say she is not happy. They say she is not doing a good job. Maybe these people want to cause problems in the White House.

Pete Buttigieg is in charge of transportation. He wanted to be president in 2020. He is important to watch. Maybe he could replace Harris. Or maybe he could replace Biden, if Biden only stays president for one term.

Some people are worried about the mid-term elections. Will they be fair? Republican leaders in some states are making it harder to vote. They are also drawing voting maps to help Republicans win. It is harder for the other parties to win. One study says Republicans will win at least five more seats in the House because of these maps. This could give Republicans control of the House before the voting even starts.

Many people from Central America want to come to the US. They are going to the border. This will probably be a problem in 2022. Harris was supposed to help with this problem. But she has not done well so far. People say she and Biden are using the same strict rules as Trump.

People also think Biden is not doing a good job. The US left Afghanistan in a hurry. It was a mess. Some people think it was like the US losing in Vietnam.

If something bad happens in another country, it could hurt Biden. For example, if Russia takes land in Ukraine, or if China attacks Taiwan, or if Israel and Iran fight. The US might have to get involved. This could ruin Biden's time as president.

In Canada, Justin Trudeau is the leader. He won another election in September. He wants to make new plans for childcare and houses that people can afford.","Here's a rewritten version of the text, adjusted for CEFR B2 level English:

The Democratic party has problems. One big problem is that the party is divided. There are two groups: progressives and moderates. They disagree on many things.

This disagreement caused problems for President Biden. He wanted to pass laws about social care and infrastructure. But the two groups in his party could not agree. The laws were changed to be weaker.

People are watching President Biden. They want to know if he will run for president again in 2024. He will be 80 years old in November. Some people wonder if he is too old. They also wonder if he can still do his job well. His popularity is low right now. It may be hard for him to become more popular.

Vice-President Kamala Harris is also being watched. Some people say she is not doing a good job. They say she seems unhappy. Some people may want to cause problems for her and President Biden.

Pete Buttigieg is the transportation secretary. He wanted to be president in 2020. People are watching him too. He could replace Kamala Harris or even President Biden. This could happen if Biden only stays president for one term.

Some people are worried about the midterm elections. They are not sure if the elections will be fair. Republicans are trying to make it harder for some people to vote. They are also changing voting areas to help Republicans win.

One study says Republicans will win at least five more seats in the House of Representatives. This is because of the changed voting areas. It could mean Republicans will control the House, even before people vote.

Many people from Central America want to come to the US. They are going to the southern border. This will be a big problem in 2022. Kamala Harris is in charge of dealing with this problem. But some people say she is not doing a good job. People say that Biden and Harris are using the same harsh rules as Trump.

People are also worried about President Biden because of Afghanistan. The US left Afghanistan in a hurry. Many people thought this was a failure. It made Biden look bad.

Other things could also cause problems for Biden. A war or conflict in another country could involve the US. This could ruin Biden's time as president. For example, Russia could invade Ukraine. China could attack Taiwan. Or Israel and Iran could start a war.

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won the election. He wants to make new rules about childcare and housing. He wants to make them more affordable.",0.8099296689033508,0.5,78.31921568627452,1.0,0.7831921568627451,0.6977072752553654,0.8938114643096924,0.6666666666666666,80.20506618789862,0.8698733453025345,0.7630126654697464,0.7744969321487019,0.7829775214195251,0.4,71.72801085972851,0.8317997285067872,0.6668200271493212,0.6165991828562821
"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","In 2021, there was an election. Justin Trudeau's party won. But they did not get many votes. It was the smallest number of votes for a winning party ever. Maybe people do not like Trudeau as much now.

There are some problems. People are talking about corruption. They are talking about how Trudeau handled the pandemic. There are also problems with trade with the US. And there are problems with the plan to reduce carbon.

Africa is a big place. Many important things will happen in Africa in 2022. One big question is about vaccines. Rich countries have most of the vaccines. Poor countries, like many in Africa, do not. Most people in Africa are not vaccinated.

Will rich countries share vaccines? They do not want to give away extra vaccines. They do not want to share how they make vaccines. This could cause problems for Africa. The pandemic also has made other problems. It has hurt the health and money of people in Africa.

Will this selfishness hurt rich countries too? Gordon Brown said it might. Omicron started in South Africa. New types of Covid could appear in 2022. Rich countries might only try to protect themselves. They might not help other countries.

We do not know what will happen with the pandemic in 2022. We do not know how it will hurt health and money. But in Africa, many people are young. Young people do not get as sick from Covid. The big problem in Africa might be other diseases. Covid is making it harder to treat other diseases.

About 25 million people in Africa have HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria kills about 400,000 people each year. It might be harder to treat these diseases. It might also be harder to treat TB and diabetes. This is because Covid is making the health systems worse.

Some people think Africa is now the center for terrorism. This might continue in 2022. The Sahel area is seeing more radical groups. These groups are mostly from Africa. But they say they are connected to groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western countries might try to stop these groups.","Here's the rewritten text, simplified to CEFR B1 level:

**Canada**

In 2021, there was an election in Canada. Justin Trudeau's party won. But they did not get many votes. It was the lowest number of votes for a winning party ever. Some people think Trudeau is not as popular as before.

There are some problems now. People are talking about possible bad actions. They are also talking about how the government handled the virus. Trade with the United States is another problem. Also, there are different ideas about reducing carbon use.

**Africa**

Africa is a very big place. Many important things will happen there in 2022. One big question is about vaccines. Rich countries have most of the vaccines. They don't want to share them. Africa may suffer because of this. They may pay a high price because of this. This could hurt their health and their money.

Will this selfishness hurt the rich countries too? Gordon Brown, a former leader of the UK, thinks it might. The Omicron virus started in South Africa. This shows that more viruses could appear in 2022.

Rich countries might only try to protect themselves. They might not help other countries. We don't know what will happen with the virus in 2022. It could hurt people's health and their money.

Many people in Africa are young. They might not get very sick from the virus. But the virus could make other health problems worse. Many people in Africa have HIV-Aids. About 25 million people will have it in 2022. Many people die from malaria every year. About 400,000 people die. It will be harder to treat these diseases because of the virus. Diseases like TB and diabetes will also be harder to treat.

Some people think Africa is now a big center for terrorism. It is like the Middle East was before. This may continue in 2022. The Sahel area in Africa has many new groups of radical Muslims. They are from Africa, but they are connected to groups like al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western countries might try to stop these groups in 2022. They might try to stop the violence.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

**Africa**

Africa is a big continent. Big events will happen there in 2022. One important issue is vaccines. Many Africans are not vaccinated. Rich countries have most of the vaccines. They are not sharing extra vaccines or patents. This could hurt Africa's health and economy.

Will this selfishness hurt rich countries later? Gordon Brown, a former UK leader, thinks so. The Omicron virus started in South Africa. This shows new viruses can appear in 2022. Rich countries might only protect themselves. They might not work together with other countries.

"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought.","The leaders of the USA and France, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, made an agreement to work together. France stopped its soldiers from working in Mali because they did not have enough help.

Many countries are worried about the spread of dangerous ideas in Africa. These ideas come from groups in countries like Nigeria. They are spreading to other countries like Congo and Mozambique.

Somalia is a country with problems. A group called al-Shabaab is active there. Somalia shows what can happen when terrorism is not stopped.

The USA will have a meeting about democracy. The problem of not having democracy in many places will be a big topic. This is important in Africa, where some countries had changes in power in 2021, like in Sudan.

Poverty is a big problem that is connected to democracy. A group called the International Rescue Committee says that many countries in Africa are in danger. They may have bigger problems with people needing help.

These countries are: Ethiopia, South Sudan, Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, and Cameroon.

Other countries outside of Africa are also in danger. These are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, and Venezuela.

In East Africa, Ethiopia has many problems. There is a war that is getting worse. This war could break the country apart. The country next to it, Eritrea, is also making things worse.

The United Nations (UN) says that there will be a big drought in Somalia. This will put many people in danger. About 7.7 million people may be in trouble by April.

Another part of the UN, called Unicef, is asking for money. They need $9.4 billion to help people around the world. They want to help over 327 million people, including 177 million children. These people are having problems because of disasters and Covid.

These problems make another problem bigger: migration. People are moving from their homes because of war, unfair treatment, or money problems. Climate change, hunger, and drought are also making people leave their homes.","The leaders of the US and France, Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, made an agreement to work together. France stopped its military work in Mali because it did not have enough help.

Many countries are worried. They see that radical Islamist ideas are spreading in Africa. These ideas come from countries like Nigeria. They are going to other countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. These countries have a lot of energy resources.

Somalia is a country with many problems. The group al-Shabaab is active there. Somalia shows what can happen when terrorism is not stopped.

The US will have another meeting about democracy. The meeting is called ""summit for democracy."" The problem of global democratic governance will be important. This means that many countries do not have good governments. This is a big problem in Africa. In 2021, some countries in Africa had coups. Sudan was one of them.

Poverty is a big problem in Africa. It is connected to the problem of bad governments. The International Rescue Committee is a charity. They say that 12 of the 20 countries with the biggest risk of humanitarian crises are in Africa. These countries are: Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon.

Other countries also have problems. These countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.

In the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has many problems. There is a civil war. This war could break up the country. Eritrea is a nearby country. It is getting involved in the war.

The United Nations says that the drought is getting worse in Somalia. By April, 7.7 million people in Somalia could be in danger.

Unicef is a charity that helps children. They need $9.4 billion to help people around the world. They want to help 327 million people, including 177 million children. These people are having problems because of crises and Covid.

These problems create another big challenge: international migration. People are leaving their homes. Some are refugees from wars. Some are looking for asylum because they are being treated badly in their countries. Some are economic migrants. They are leaving because of climate change, hunger, and drought.","The leaders of the US and France made an agreement to work together. This happened after France stopped its military actions in Mali because they did not have enough support.

Many countries are worried. They see dangerous ideas from radical Islamist groups spreading in West Africa. These ideas are going from countries like Nigeria to places like Congo and Mozambique.

Somalia is a country that is not doing well. A group called al-Shabaab is causing problems there. Somalia shows what can happen when terrorism is not stopped. This is a warning for other countries.

The US will have a meeting about democracy. The meeting will talk about how countries are governed. This is a big issue, especially in Africa. Several countries in Africa had changes in government in 2021. Sudan is one example.

Poverty is also a big problem. It is connected to the way countries are governed. The International Rescue Committee says that many countries in Africa are at risk of having very bad problems.

They say that the following countries are at risk: Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger, and Cameroon.

Other countries that are also at risk include Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon, and Venezuela.

In the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has many problems. There is a civil war that is getting worse. This war could break up the country. The country next to Ethiopia, Eritrea, is also causing problems.

The United Nations says that there will be a bad drought in Somalia. This drought will put many people at risk. About 7.7 million people in Somalia could be in danger by April.

UNICEF is a charity that helps children. They are asking for a lot of money to help people around the world. They need $9.4 billion to help over 327 million people. This includes 177 million children. These people are having problems because of wars, sickness, and other bad things.

"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars.","In 2020, many people moved to other countries. The UN says that 281 million people were living in a different country. This is 3.6% of all people in the world.

More people are moving, even though it is hard to travel now. Countries have rules about travel because of the sickness.

These big changes in where people live are hard for governments. Many governments are not working together to find good solutions. This is especially true in rich countries like those in North America and Europe. Maybe things will change in 2022, but we don't know.

There will be a meeting about the weather in Egypt in November. It is called Cop27. At the meeting, countries will talk about what they promised to do in Glasgow. They promised to make less carbon and methane. They also promised to stop cutting down trees, use less coal, and help poor countries that are hurt by bad weather.

It is not likely that the weather will get better quickly. We will probably see more bad weather in 2022, like we did in 2021. There will be fires, not enough water, too much water, big storms, and very hot days.

Places like Antarctica and the Arctic will be affected. There will be more people in these places in 2022. This might not be good.

More tourists are going to Antarctica. Big planes can now land there. China and other countries want to use things from Antarctica. They might also want to build army places there.

The ice in the Arctic is melting. Now ships can go across the top of the world. Russia and other countries are trying to use these new paths.

Greenland has many minerals. Companies want to mine there. Countries also want to use Greenland for defense. But people who live there don't want to give permission to the companies.

There will be a lot of things happening in space in 2022. Countries will explore space and compete with each other. NASA is planning many trips. They want to send people back to the moon. They will build a new space station. Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan will send spaceships to the moon. Europe wants to send a spaceship to Mars.","The United Nations says that many people moved to other countries in 2020. The number is about 281 million people. That is 3.6% of all people in the world.

This number is still going up. This is happening even though it is hard to move between countries now. This is because of the pandemic.

Many people are moving, but governments are not working together to help. Rich countries in North America and Europe are not doing much. Maybe this will change in 2022, but it is not likely.

There will be a meeting about climate change in Egypt in November. It is called Cop27. This meeting is after another meeting in Glasgow about climate change.

At the meeting, people will talk about what they promised to do in Glasgow. They promised to use less carbon, stop cutting down trees, use less coal, and help poor countries.

It is not likely that the world's climate will get better quickly. We will probably have very bad weather again this year. We saw bad weather like fires, dry weather, floods, storms, and hot days in 2021.

The bad weather will hurt the Earth a lot. The Arctic and Antarctic areas are very sensitive. They will be affected a lot.

There will be more people going to the Arctic and Antarctic in 2022. This is not good.

For example, many tourists are going to Antarctica. They are using big planes that can land on the ice.

Also, China and other countries want to use the resources in Antarctica. They also want to build military bases there. This is a problem.

The ice in the Arctic is melting. This makes it possible to sail across the top of the world. Russia is building new paths for ships. Other countries are also trying to do this.

Greenland has many minerals. Mining companies want to mine there. Defence people are also interested in Greenland. But the people who live there do not want to give permission for this.

There will also be a lot of activity in space this year. People will explore space and compete with each other.

NASA is planning 18 missions in 2022. They want to send people to the moon again. They are planning a new space station called Gateway.

Russia, South Korea, India, and Japan will send spaceships to the moon. The European Space Agency will send a mission to Mars.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B2 level:

In 2020, a lot of people lived in countries that were not their own. The UN says this number was 281 million. That is about 3.6% of all the people in the world. This is a record number.

The number of migrants is still increasing. This is happening even though it is difficult to travel between countries because of the pandemic.

Many people are moving to different countries. But governments are not working together to handle this situation. Rich countries in North America and Europe especially need to do more. Maybe things will get better in 2022. But it might not happen.

The next big meeting about the climate is called Cop27. It will be in Egypt in November. This meeting will check on the promises made in Glasgow at Cop26. Countries promised to reduce carbon and methane. They also promised to stop cutting down forests, use less coal, and stop giving money to fossil fuels. Rich countries also promised to help poor countries with the damage caused by climate change.

We should not expect the climate to improve quickly. The extreme weather from 2021 will likely happen again. There will be fires, droughts, floods, storms, and very hot temperatures.

These problems will be worse in places that are already weak, like Antarctica and the Arctic. There will be more human activity in these areas in 2022. This might not be a good thing.

More tourists are visiting Antarctica. Big planes can now land there. China and other countries want to use Antarctica's resources and build military bases there. This is also a problem.

The ice in the Arctic is melting. This is opening up new shipping routes for businesses and the navy. Russia is building these routes. Other countries are competing with Russia.

Greenland has many minerals. Mining companies want to use them. Defence planners are also interested in Greenland. But people who live there do not want to give out mining licenses.

"China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.","China wants to have a space station. It wants the station to work well by the end of this year.

Russia and some companies are starting space trips for tourists. Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic, is doing this. Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, is also doing it.

But there is also a bad thing happening. Countries might start a nuclear war in space. The US, Russia, and China are making new weapons.

These weapons can go around the Earth very fast. They can launch nuclear missiles from space. This is dangerous.

Russia tested a missile that can destroy satellites in 2021. This made many people angry. Other countries might do the same. This could be bad for how we talk to each other around the world. We use satellites for talking.

NASA is also doing something interesting. NASA wants to hit a big rock in space. The rock is called an asteroid. NASA wants to change where the asteroid is going.

They will use a spaceship. The spaceship will crash into the asteroid. Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, made the rocket for the spaceship.

The US says this is to protect the Earth. They call it “planetary defence.” But this technology can also be used to attack.

Some people think this is good. Other people think this is a bad thing for people on Earth.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR level B1:

"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","Many scientists and doctors help the UK government. They give advice about the virus. But some people are very angry with them.

A newspaper called the Guardian asked these experts about their experiences. Many said they were treated very badly.

Some people online were mean to them. Some people sent them death threats. This means they said they would kill them.

Some people took pictures of their houses. They put the pictures online. Some people sent strange packages in the mail. The packages had bad messages.

People also sent angry messages on Twitter and in emails. They made mean phone calls. They sent hate mail. They said they would hurt them.

Some people complained to their bosses. Some complained to a group that checks doctors. Some people left bad notes on their cars. Some people shouted bad things through their doors.

The police caught some people who made threats. But it was only a few cases.

The abuse did not only happen to the experts. Their students, friends, and families were also targeted. This included their partners and children.

One doctor who gives advice said people were very rude to the people who worked at his office. They shouted at them because of his work.

In another case, a teacher was mean to a child. The teacher blamed the child's parent for the rules about staying home. The family did not complain because the teacher would give the child a grade.

The Guardian newspaper sent questions to over 100 scientists, doctors, and researchers. They help the government by giving advice. They work with groups like SAGE and Nervtag. SAGE is a group of scientists who give advice in emergencies. Nervtag is a group that studies new viruses.

The answers from the experts were kept secret. Three out of four experts said they got a lot of abuse. This was about what the government did, their ideas, or their research. This often happened after they spoke to the news or at meetings.

It was not just the experts who were targeted. Their students, work friends, and families were also treated badly. This included their partners and children.

One doctor said that people were very rude to the receptionists at the doctor's office. This happened because the doctor was helping the government.

"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”. The mainstream media sometimes fuelled the activity by emphasising worst-case scenarios, some respondents said, or legitimised abuse from social media trolls by launching their own attacks on advisers.","He said that if you talk about vaccines, people will react. This is especially true if you talk about vaccines for children.

But, this only happens if some newspapers write about what you say. He mentioned the Daily Mail newspaper.

One of the people who gave advice got a bad message on Twitter. Someone said they would kill him. He told the police. He got many bad messages when he was on TV.

One doctor said that many of the messages were about women. They were very bad. She said she had never seen anything like it. She is trying to help people not die.

Many people who send bad messages are worried. They are more worried about what the government is doing about the virus than the virus itself. But the people giving advice are not making the rules.

Many advisors say the bad messages happen when they talk about masks, vaccines, medicine for Covid, and lockdowns. This means it is getting worse because the Omicron virus is spreading.

Last year, at the start of the virus, many people were sending bad messages. So, experts from the government told the advisors how to stay safe. They told them to make their computers safer. They also told them to change when they go to work and how they get there. They should also check under their cars.

Some advisors had people check their homes and offices to make sure they were safe. They put in alarms and cameras. The cameras are connected to the police station.

Some universities hired security guards. The guards help the experts stay safe. They also stop people from bothering them at work.

Experts from the government tried to take down bad things online. But they could not always do it.

Many advisors got hate messages on Twitter and in emails. Some messages said, ""I hope your family die."" Some said, ""You will pay for killing our children with vaccines."" Other messages were very rude.

Government computer experts have taken down some private information from the internet. But they could not take everything down.

"The survey found no clear evidence that women received more abuse than men, but some were less willing to describe their experiences. Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on. Do we acquiesce and allow them to take over and risk people’s lives?”","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

The survey asked people about bad treatment. It did not find that women got more bad treatment than men. But some women did not want to talk about what happened to them.

Many men were sad about the bad treatment of women they knew. One man said women get much more bad treatment than men.

Some people gave bad treatment. But many people also said thank you and gave support. This made some people feel better. One person said the support helped them not care about the bad treatment.

George Freeman is a science minister. He said the bad treatment is very bad. He said everyone who likes freedom must say it is wrong. He said scientists and doctors should not be blamed for choices made by ministers. Ministers must answer to the parliament.

Chi Onwurah is a shadow science minister. She said the bad treatment is not okay. She said the government needs a new law to stop wrong information online. This law is needed very much.

The Cabinet Office and the Sage group helped people a lot. But some people wanted to know about the bad treatment before they started. They also wanted safety advice.

Because of the bad treatment, some scientists do not want to talk. They do not want to give interviews. They may stop talking to the public.

But most scientists said the bad treatment did not change them. It even made them stronger. One person said it made them want to talk more. They said their voice was important.

"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Ashraf Ghani was the president of Afghanistan. He left Kabul four months ago. Now, he is talking about it for the first time.

He says that other countries, especially America, are the reason Afghanistan fell.

Ghani told the BBC that he had to leave Kabul very fast. His helper, Hamdullah Mohib, was very scared. The soldiers protecting the president were also scared. They said they would die if Ghani stayed.

Ghani said Mohib only gave him two minutes to leave.

He talked to Nick Carter. Carter used to be a top soldier in Britain.

Before Ghani left, the Taliban were taking over Afghanistan. When Ghani left quickly, it ended plans for a peaceful change of power. It also stopped other countries from helping Afghanistan.

Now, many people in Afghanistan are hungry. The country is having money problems. Hospitals and schools are in bad shape because other countries stopped giving money. They needed that money.

Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people. Many people think Ghani is to blame for the bad situation.

Ghani said his big mistake was trusting other countries. He thought they would help Afghanistan for a long time. He said everyone was wrong about that.

Ghani said America did not include his government in talks with the Taliban. These talks were about peace. Ghani said the deals that America made with the Taliban hurt the Afghan people. They only helped American soldiers leave safely.

Ghani said America is responsible for what happened. He said his government never had a chance to talk to the Taliban.","Ashraf Ghani used to be the president of Afghanistan. He has now spoken for the first time since he left Kabul four months ago. Kabul is the capital city of Afghanistan.

Ghani spoke to General Nick Carter. Carter used to be in charge of the British army. He was working as a guest editor for a radio show.

The Taliban were taking control of Afghanistan before Ghani left. When Ghani left quickly, it stopped any chance of a peaceful change of power. This meant that aid stopped coming to Afghanistan. There were also no plans for everyone to work together in the government.

Now, many people in Afghanistan are hungry. The country's money problems are very bad. The health and schools are in trouble because foreign money stopped coming. They needed this money to survive.

Carter asked Ghani what he would say to the Afghan people. Many people in Afghanistan think Ghani is to blame for the problems. Ghani said his biggest mistake was trusting the countries that helped Afghanistan.

Ghani said people can blame him for this, and they are right to do so. He trusted the world to help. He thought the world would be patient, but he was wrong.

Ghani said the United States did not include his government in talks with the Taliban. These talks were about peace. Ghani said the deals the US made with the Taliban caused problems for the Afghan people. The US wanted to leave Afghanistan quickly.

"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him. If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country.","This week, many people in South Africa will remember Desmond Tutu. He was a famous person who fought against apartheid.

"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo.

South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","Here is the rewritten text, using simple language and short sentences appropriate for CEFR A2 level:

"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","The rules about Covid say how many people can go to a funeral. In South Africa, only 100 people can go.

Nuttall and Tutu were good friends in the 1980s. They showed how a white leader and a black leader can work together. Church people told this to reporters.

Tutu was born in a small town. The town is called Klerksdorp. It is near Johannesburg. He was born on October 7, 1931.

He was a teacher, but he did not like the unfair laws in South Africa. So, he stopped teaching in 1958. This was after the National party won the election. They started a system called apartheid. Apartheid was very unfair to black people.

Tutu studied religion in the UK. He would ask for directions, even when he didn't need them. White police officers would call him ""Sir."" This surprised him.

Tutu became important in the church. He became a leader. In the 1970s, he was famous. He helped people in other countries understand the problems in South Africa. He made leaders think about helping the black people in South Africa.

Nelson Mandela became president in 1994. It was the first time everyone could vote. Tutu said South Africa was a ""Rainbow Nation."" He wanted people to live together in peace. He led a group that told the truth about apartheid.

Tutu also talked about problems with the new leaders. He told Mandela that ministers got too much money. He said President Jacob Zuma was doing bad things. Zuma stopped being president in 2018.

"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","It was a bad year for human rights in Russia. Alexei Navalny, a leader against the government, went to prison. Then, the group called International Memorial was closed. This was a very harsh action.

Memorial started in the 1980s. Andrei Sakharov and other people who disagreed with the Soviet government started it. Mikhail Gorbachev gave people more freedom. Memorial used this freedom. They told the truth about many people who suffered under Stalin. Stalin was a leader in the past. He was very cruel.

Memorial showed that Russia was becoming more open. For many Russians, this was important. They learned what happened to their families. They learned about their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. This was secret for many years.

Closing Memorial is a symbol. It shows that Russian society is being destroyed very fast. The leaders of Memorial hoped people would help them. They hoped important people like Gorbachev would help. They thought the government would not close them. Memorial helped people learn about bad things from the Soviet past. The leaders thought this was too important to stop.

But on Tuesday, a judge closed Memorial. It was almost 30 years after the Soviet Union ended. Nikita Petrov is a historian. He helped start Memorial. He said he never thought things would get so bad. He said he was probably naive.

It is easy to see why Putin does not like Memorial. Putin thinks a lot about the past. He thinks about Crimea, NATO, and the Soviet Union. He thinks about World War Two. He sees Memorial as a threat to Russia. He cares more about what he thinks are wrongs against Russia. He does not care about the truth that Memorial found. Memorial worked for 30 years in the Russian archives.

Memorial said that Russia needs to understand the Soviet past. They said this is important for the future. They wrote this after they were closed.","This was a very bad year for human rights in Russia. It started with Alexei Navalny going to jail. Then, a very important group called International Memorial was closed. This was a cruel thing to do.

International Memorial started in the 1980s. Andrei Sakharov and other people who disagreed with the Soviet government started it. The Soviet Union was the name of Russia a long time ago.

When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader, things became more free. International Memorial used this freedom. They told the truth about what happened to many people under Stalin. Stalin was a leader who killed many people.

International Memorial showed that Russia was becoming more open. It helped people learn about their families. Many Russians found out sad things about their parents and grandparents. For many years, these things were secret.

Closing International Memorial is a bad sign. It shows that the government is taking apart groups that help people. The leaders of International Memorial hoped people would help them. They thought that famous Russians like Gorbachev would help.

They also thought that the government would not close them. They believed that closing a group that told the truth about the Soviet Union was too much. But on Tuesday, a judge closed them. This was 30 years after the Soviet Union ended.

Nikita Petrov helped start International Memorial. He said he never thought things would get so bad. He thought Russia would become a country with laws and freedom.

It is easy to see why Putin does not like International Memorial. Putin is the leader of Russia now. He thinks a lot about history. He thinks about Crimea, Nato, and the Soviet Union. He also thinks about World War Two.

Putin thinks that learning about Soviet history is bad for Russia. He cares more about bad things that happened to Russia in the past. He does not care about the truth that International Memorial found in the archives.

International Memorial said that Russia needs to understand its Soviet past. They said this is important for the future. They said this after they were closed.","Here's a B2-level rewrite of the text, following your instructions:

The year was very bad for human rights in Russia. A big problem was that Alexei Navalny, an important leader against the government, was put in jail. Another big problem was that the group International Memorial was shut down. This was a very harsh action.

International Memorial started in the 1980s. Andrei Sakharov and other people who disagreed with the Soviet government created it. At that time, the Soviet Union was starting to allow more freedom. The group used this freedom to find out the truth about what happened to many people under Stalin. Stalin was a leader who killed or hurt millions.

The group was a sign that Russia was becoming more open. It helped Russians learn about the sad stories of their families. For many years, these stories were secret because the government was afraid to tell the truth.

Closing Memorial shows that Russian society is changing very quickly. The leaders of Memorial thought people would support them. They hoped important people, like Gorbachev, would help them. They also thought the government would not close a group that was finding out about bad things from the past. They believed that would be too much, even for President Putin.

But on Tuesday, a judge decided to close the group. This was almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union ended. Nikita Petrov helped start Memorial. He is a historian who studies the past. He told a newspaper that he never thought things would get so bad. He said he was probably too hopeful in the past.

It is easy to see why President Putin does not like Memorial. He is very concerned about the past, like Crimea, NATO, and the end of the Soviet Union. He thinks that looking into the past of the Soviet Union is a danger to Russia. He cares more about things he thinks were unfair to Russia in the past. He does not care about the truths that Memorial found in the Russian archives.

After the group was closed, Memorial said something. They said that Russia needs to understand its past honestly. They think this is important for the future.",0.9186975955963135,0.5,67.75453194006312,1.0,0.6775453194006311,0.6987476383323149,0.9029833078384399,0.6666666666666666,63.452485092542446,1.0,0.6345248509254244,0.734724941810177,0.8378491401672363,0.8,67.48915653093604,0.9377710867265989,0.65622289132734,0.7646906771648588
"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","The government closed Memorial. Memorial talked about many people dying. It talked about bad things that happened to them.

The government wants to show these deaths in a different way. They want to say the deaths were bad. But they don't want to say who killed the people. They want to remember the people who died. But they don't want to talk about who did the killing.

The government says Memorial closed because of laws about ""foreign agents."" But the real reason is different.

In court, a person from the government said Memorial was wrong. He said Memorial made the USSR (Soviet Union) look like a bad country. He said, ""We are the children of the winners. Why should we see bad people from our country praised?""

A lawyer for Memorial said this was like a trial from the 1930s.

The people from Memorial do not know why the government closed them. They think the government did not like their work about the past. They think the government did not like that they helped people like Navalny.

Memorial did the same things it always did. But Russia changed. Russia does not want people to talk about the past anymore.

Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch said the government is afraid. He said the government does not want people to know what really happened. He said, ""If the truth is bad, the government should change what it does. It should not stop people from telling the truth.""","Instead of Memorial, the government wants to show the deaths of millions in a different way. Memorial talked openly about terrible things that happened. The government wants to show the deaths in a more careful way.

They want to say that the deaths were bad, but not talk about who killed the people. They want to name the people who died, but not the people who did the killings.

The Russian government says that closing Memorial is just following the rules about ""foreign agents."" But in court, a lawyer for the government said something else. He said that Memorial was wrongly showing the USSR (Soviet Union) as a bad country. He said Memorial was showing the USSR like a country that uses terror.

The government lawyer asked why they should see people who betrayed their country and helped the Nazis being made to look good. He said that they are the children of the people who won the war.

A lawyer for Memorial said this reminded him of a fake trial from the 1930s.

The people in charge of Memorial do not know why the government closed them down. They don't know what they did wrong.

Some people think it is because Memorial kept records about bad things the Soviet Union did. Others think it is because Memorial helped people in jail for political reasons, like Navalny.

But the truth is that Memorial kept doing the same things. It is Russia that has changed. Maybe Russia is no longer okay with people talking honestly about its past.

Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch said that the government is afraid. He said that the government does not want Memorial to show what it is doing. He said that if the truth is bad, the government should change its actions, not try to hide the truth.","Instead of Memorial, the government wants something different. Memorial talked strongly about terrible things that happened to many people. The new group will talk about deaths in a more careful way.

This new group will say the deaths were bad. But it will not say who killed the people. It will name the people who died, but not the people who did the killing.

The Russian government wants people to think closing Memorial was simple. They say it was because of rules about ""foreign agents.""

But in court, a lawyer showed the real reason. He said Memorial was lying about the USSR. He said Memorial was saying the USSR was like a terrorist country.

The lawyer asked why people should see traitors being praised. He said these traitors helped the Nazis.

A lawyer for Memorial said this reminded him of a trial from the 1930s. These trials were not fair.

The people who lead Memorial do not know why the government closed them. They do not know what they did wrong.

Some people think it is because of Memorial's work about Soviet terror. Others think it is because Memorial helps political prisoners like Navalny.

But Memorial has always done the same thing. Russia has changed. Russia used to let people talk honestly about the past. Maybe that time is over.

Kenneth Roth from Human Rights Watch said something important. He said the government is afraid of the honest stories Memorial tells.

"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some cities in Spain are doing something new. They are offering ""menstrual leave"" to their workers. This means women can take time off work when they have period pain.

The city of Girona was the first in Spain to do this. They want to help workers who feel bad because of their periods. They allow women to work in a different way or take time off.

In Girona, women can take up to eight hours off each month. But they need to work those hours later, within three months.

Maria Àngels Planas is the deputy mayor of Girona. She said Girona is doing something important. They are talking about periods, which is often a secret topic. She said periods can be painful for some women.

After Girona, two other towns in Spain, Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques, started doing the same thing.

Then, the city of Castellón de la Plana also agreed to give women time off for periods. They have about 1,500 workers. Some of the workers asked for this leave.

In Asia, some countries have had rules about periods for a long time. Sometimes, this was because they worried about women having babies. They thought work could make it harder for women to have children.

In 2016, some women in Japan and China said they did not want to use the leave. They were afraid that men at work would be angry. They thought it could hurt their chances to get a better job.

In 2016, a company in England called Coexist also started offering menstrual leave. They wanted to change the way people thought about periods at work. They did not want women to have to choose between working when they felt bad, or using sick days.

This idea started a big discussion around the world. Some people liked it, and some did not. But the people at Coexist said that women were working harder and doing better work.

Studies show that some women have missed work or school because of their periods. About 14% of women have taken time off because of this.

In Girona, the worker's union asked the city to make this change. This is how the idea of menstrual leave started in Girona.","Some towns in Spain are doing something new.

She also said that they want to talk more about periods. She wants people to know that some women have pain during their period.

After Girona, two more towns in Spain, Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques, made the same rule.

Then, the city of Castellón de la Plana also said that they would let women take time off for their period. They have 1,500 workers, and they agreed to the rule after some women asked for it.

In 2016, a company in England called Coexist also started offering menstrual leave. They wanted to change the work culture. Before, women had to choose between working when they felt very bad or using sick days.

This idea caused a lot of discussion around the world. But, the managers at Coexist said workers were more dedicated and worked better. Studies showed that many women have missed work or school because of their periods.

The workers union in Girona thought about all of this when they suggested menstrual leave.",0.8686676621437073,0.5,79.17419763513514,1.0,0.7917419763513514,0.7201365461650195,0.8281666040420532,0.6666666666666666,83.27488523573203,0.7931278691066993,0.7706872130893301,0.75517349459935,0.9158100485801697,0.8,76.07478260869568,0.7231304347826079,0.6776869565217392,0.7978323350339697
"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","Here's the rewritten text at A2 level:

Sílvia Rubio works for a union. The union is called Intersindical-CSC. She said there were many problems.

The union wanted women to have time off work each month. They wanted two days off. But some people did not like this idea.

They thought companies might not hire women. Or, women might not get important jobs. So, the union changed the idea.

Rubio said that women can work more hours later. This way, everyone is treated the same.

The city council was also a problem. The union asked for 16 hours off each month. But the city council said no. They agreed to 8 hours.

Some women in the union did not like the idea. They did not understand.

Rubio said there were problems. Some women said, ""My husband has headaches. Why can't he have time off?""

Other women were worried. They thought this would make women look bad. They thought people would think periods are always painful.

Rubio said it is a good thing. She said it is important for women everywhere. It is hard to talk about periods. No one is helping. But they did it!

Rubio wants to do more. She wants better workplaces. She wants more time off for other problems. For example, long-term sickness or taking care of family.

"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has a new record for coronavirus cases.

"Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

**Spain Changes Isolation Time**

Spain had a rule. People with Covid had to stay home for ten days. Now, the rule is different. They only need to stay home for seven days. This is because many new people are getting sick. The number is very high. Businesses are worried. They think too many people will be sick and cannot work.

**Italy Changes Rules Too**

Italy has a new rule. People who got three Covid shots do not need to stay home. This is if they were near someone with Covid.
Italy also has new rules for people without shots. After January 10th, they need a health pass. The pass shows they got shots or had Covid before. They need this pass to ride the bus, train, or airplane in Italy. They also talked about new rules for workers without shots, but they did not agree on this.

**Italy Cancels Parties**

Italy and other countries stopped some parties. This is because Covid is spreading again.

**Greece Adds New Rules**

Greece stopped Christmas and New Year parties in public. Now, they have new rules for restaurants and bars. The rules start now, not in January. This is because Greece has many new Covid cases. On Wednesday, there were 21,657 cases. This is more than double the cases from Monday.

Spain had a rule: If you had Covid-19, you had to stay home for ten days. Now, Spain changed this rule. You only need to stay home for seven days. This happened because many businesses were worried. They thought too many workers would be sick. This would make it hard to do business.

Italy also made some changes. If you have had three Covid-19 shots, you do not need to stay home if you are near someone with Covid-19.

Italy also has new rules for people who did not get the vaccine. From January 10, you need a health pass to travel. This pass shows you got the vaccine or you had Covid-19 and got better.

Germany is waiting for more people to get sick with the new virus. Right now, fewer people are getting sick. But the health minister said that the real number of sick people might be higher. He thinks this because fewer people are getting tested because of the holidays. He said the real number could be much bigger than what they are reporting.

It also limited private gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, or just two households if an unvaccinated person is present. The rules came on top of restrictions already hitting the unvaccinated, who are barred from shops, restaurants and cultural events.

"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","Ukrainian soldiers are fighting in the east and south of Ukraine. They are getting closer to Kreminna. Kreminna is a city controlled by Russia. It is in the Luhansk area.

Serhiy Haidai is in charge of the Luhansk area. He said that Russian soldiers had to go back to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is a town near Kreminna. This happened because of the Ukrainian soldiers.

Haidai said that if Russia loses Kreminna, it will be hard for them. He said the Russians built strong defenses in Kreminna. They have many soldiers and equipment there. They are getting more help all the time.

It is not possible to check what is happening on the battlefield right now.

If Ukraine gets Kreminna and Svatove back, they can attack Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer.

The fighting is very bad. There are no talks to stop the war soon.

Sergei Lavrov is a Russian leader. He said Ukraine must agree to what Russia wants. He said Ukraine must stop having weapons. He also used the word ""denazification"". If not, Russia will win the war.

Lavrov's words show that Russia still wants to change the government in Ukraine. This is what they wanted from the start. Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to talk about ending the war. But Lavrov's words show that is not true.

Britain's defence ministry talked about the war. They said Russian soldiers are trying to capture Bakhmut. Bakhmut is a city in the Donetsk area.

Russian soldiers and Wagner fighters have been trying to take Bakhmut since July. They are now near the city. Bakhmut is very damaged after five months of fighting. People call it the ""Bakhmut meat-grinder.""

The fight for Bakhmut is important for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He is in charge of the Wagner group. He is using many convicts from Russian prisons to fight in Bakhmut.","Ukrainian soldiers are fighting to get back the city of Kreminna. Kreminna is in the Luhansk area. Russia controls this city now.

Serhiy Haidai said something about the fighting. He is the governor of the Luhansk area. He said that Russian soldiers had to move back. They moved to a town called Rubizhne. This town is near Kreminna. The Ukrainian army made the Russian soldiers move.

Haidai also said that Kreminna is important for Russia. If Russia loses Kreminna, it will be hard for them to defend the area. The Russian army built strong defenses in Kreminna. They used a lot of soldiers and equipment.

It is hard to know exactly what is happening in the fighting.

If Ukraine gets Kreminna and Svatove back, they can attack other cities. These cities are Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Ukraine lost these cities in the summer.

The fighting is very bad. There are no peace talks happening soon.

Sergei Lavrov said something on Monday. He works for Russia. He said that Ukraine must do what Russia wants. Russia wants Ukraine to have less weapons. Russia also wants Ukraine to get rid of Nazis. If Ukraine does not do these things, Russia will win the war.

Lavrov's words show that Russia still wants to change the government in Ukraine. This is even though Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to talk about ending the war.

The British defence ministry said that Russia is trying to take the city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is in the Donetsk area. Russian soldiers and Wagner fighters are trying to take Bakhmut.

They have been trying to take Bakhmut since July. The fighting has damaged Bakhmut very badly. Both sides call Bakhmut the ""Bakhmut meat-grinder."" This means a lot of people are getting hurt or killed there.

The fight for Bakhmut is important for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He is in charge of the Wagner group.

"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory. Since the start of the war, a number of military targets, including oil and weapon depots have been damaged after catching fire. Kyiv does not publicly admit to attacks inside Russia but has previously cheered such incidents as payback.","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

Prigozhin said bad things about the Russian army. He said Wagner soldiers are the best fighters in the country.

The Guardian newspaper is not sure if the video is real. But Russian reporters asked Prigozhin about it. Prigozhin seemed happy about what the soldiers did. He said he went to Bakhmut to meet them.

Prigozhin said, ""The soldiers told me to say that it's hard to know about problems at the front when you are in a warm office."" It looks like he was criticizing the army leaders.

"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","European countries are getting ready. They want to watch for new kinds of coronavirus. The virus might come from China.

China is changing its rules about the virus. Spain and France are asking people from China to take tests at the airport.

Spain and France are like Italy. They want people from China to show a test that says they do not have the virus. But Spain has a rule. People who have all their shots do not need a test.

A leader in Spain, Carolina Darias, talked about the new rules. She wants to change the rules for the EU's special health paper. This paper is called a digital Covid certificate.

In China, many people are sick. Some countries do not trust the numbers from China. So, these countries are checking people for the virus again.

These countries include the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The UK will also do this.

China says these tests are not fair. They think the tests are about politics. China thinks other countries want to make China look bad.

Some leaders in Europe are watching. They think it is important to be careful. But they do not think it is time to worry too much about China.

A leader in Germany, Karl Lauterbach, said tests are not needed yet. People can come to Germany from China without tests. Germany is part of a group of countries with open borders.

He said the information from China is not good. So, Germany needs to check for the virus themselves. They will look at people on planes.

A health leader in Europe, Stella Kyriakides, has asked countries to watch for new kinds of the virus. She wants them to check people who are sick. She also wants them to check the water from airports. This can help find new viruses from China.

Karl Lauterbach is the health minister in Germany. He said it is not necessary to make people take tests if they are coming from China through Germany. Germany is part of the Schengen area, where people can travel without showing passports.

"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported.

"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is ready for a big New Year. It will be a very important time for the country.

"That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","Brasilia is not happy.

"The former athlete of the century will be laid to rest at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica, a vertical cemetery with space for 18,000 bodies that claims to be the tallest in the world. Pelé chose and paid for a space on the ninth floor of the building almost two decades ago, according to the newspaper O Globo. He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out.

"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","In 2022, many countries had problems. They had Covid and a possible war in Ukraine. But China was quiet.

China had a plan to stop Covid. It was called ""zero-Covid"". It seemed to work. There were few Covid cases.

Sometimes, cities were locked down. People followed the rules. China was stable.

Xi Jinping wanted to stay in power. He wanted to rule China for a third time. He hoped for a good year.

He wanted China to be strong. He wanted to control China. He also wanted Taiwan. He wanted China to be important in the world.

But now, the year is ending. China is facing new problems. The last year was hard.

There were problems with houses and the economy. There was trouble with Taiwan in August. Some countries put rules on China because of human rights. The US made rules about chips for computers. China and Russia are friends, but it is not easy.

Xi Jinping is still in power. But after he took power, people started to protest. They were very brave. They wanted the ""zero-Covid"" plan to end.

2022 was supposed to be a good year for Xi Jinping. But it was not. Jerome Cohen knows a lot about China. He said that Xi Jinping has many worries now. China is in trouble. Many people do not like him.

In October, there was a meeting. It was called the 20th party congress. Xi Jinping got a third term. He is now the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

Before, leaders did not want one person to have too much power. But Xi Jinping changed that.

He added his ideas to the party's plan. He also removed people who did not agree with him. One person was Hu Jintao. He was taken away from the meeting.

Now, Xi Jinping has a lot of power. Some people are worried. They are afraid of what he will do. He is surrounded by people who always agree with him.

Professor Steve Tsang said that Xi Jinping getting a third term is the most important thing for China in 2022.","In 2022, the world had problems. There was Covid and a war in Ukraine. But China was calm at the start of the year.

China had a plan to stop Covid. It was called ""zero-Covid."" It seemed to work, and there were not many Covid cases.

Sometimes, cities had to close. But people followed the rules. China was stable.

Xi Jinping is the leader of China. He wanted to have a third term as leader. This would be a big thing for him. He wanted China to be strong.

He also wanted China to be the most powerful country. He wanted to control Taiwan. He wanted to have more power in the world.

But now, at the end of 2022, things are different. China has new problems.

There are problems with houses and money. There was a problem with Taiwan in August. Some countries are angry about China's human rights. The US is stopping China from making computer chips. China is friends with Russia, but this is difficult.

Xi Jinping became the leader for a third time. But after that, people started to protest. They were very brave. Then, the ""zero-Covid"" plan suddenly ended.

2022 was supposed to be a good year for Xi Jinping. But now he has many worries. He has problems in his country. People are not happy with him.

In October, there was a meeting. It was called the 20th party congress. Xi Jinping got to be leader for five more years. He is now the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

Before, leaders did not want one person to have too much power. But Xi Jinping changed that.

He made his ideas very important. He also removed people who did not agree with him. One person was even taken out of the meeting hall.

Now, Xi Jinping has a lot of power. Some people are worried about what he will do. He is surrounded by people who always agree with him.

Xi probably wanted this calm situation as he took power for a third time. This was a big event in China.

He had big goals for China. He wanted the economy to be strong. He wanted to control the country. He also wanted to take over Taiwan and have more power in the world.

But as 2022 ends and 2023 starts, China is facing new and difficult problems.

In the past year, there have been problems with houses and the economy. There was also tension with Taiwan in August.

Other countries put rules on China because of human rights issues. The US also made rules about China's chip industry. China's friendship with Russia is also causing problems.

Xi did get his third term as leader. But then, people started protesting. They were very brave. These protests seemed to end the ""zero-Covid"" plan suddenly.

Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a good year for Xi. But now, he has many worries.

Jerome Cohen, a China expert, said that China is in trouble. He thinks Xi has lost respect from many people.

In October, there was a meeting called the 20th Party Congress. At this meeting, Xi got a third term. This made him the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

Before Xi, leaders had rules to stop one person from having too much power. But Xi changed that.

He made his own ideas, called ""Xi Jinping thought,"" the most important ideas of the party. He also got rid of people who disagreed with him. One example was when the former president, Hu Jintao, was taken out of the meeting hall.

Now Xi has a lot of power. Some people worry about what he will do. They think he might make bad decisions because he is surrounded by people who always agree with him.

"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division. Relations were further strained by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine just weeks after Xi and Vladimir Putin announced a “limitless” friendship, and which Beijing refused to condemn.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level English learners:

Xi has a plan for China. He thinks it is good. But some people think he is taking China in a new and risky direction.

One worrying plan is about Taiwan. Xi may want to take Taiwan. But experts do not think this will happen soon.

Last year, China’s army did more near Taiwan than ever before. Taiwan governs itself.

In August, China said it might use force to take Taiwan. This was in a special paper about Taiwan.

Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the US, visited Taiwan. China was not happy. China showed its power with more army actions. These actions were bigger than before.

The US is important for Taiwan and China. The US is helping Taiwan more. They might call Taiwan a special friend, like friends in NATO. The US will sell weapons to Taiwan.

A professor in Taiwan, Ma Chun-Wei, said China cannot fight the US easily. So, China is reacting to Taiwan and its people. Taiwan has about 23 million people.

China might use tricks and computer attacks against Taiwan. They might also try to hurt Taiwan’s money. This could happen before Taiwan’s next election in 2024.

Yun Sun works at a center in Washington. She said China will try to force Taiwan. This will happen if the Democratic Progressive party is in charge. This party wants Taiwan to be more independent.

On Monday, Taiwan said many Chinese planes flew near the island. There were 71 planes, including fighter planes. This was the most planes ever reported.

China’s actions on Taiwan are making Xi’s relationship with the West worse.

China is also treating people badly in Hong Kong. They are hurting people in Xinjiang too. The United Nations said this might be crimes against people. This makes the relationship with other countries even worse.

Russia attacked Ukraine. This made things worse too. Xi and the leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said they were very good friends. But China did not say the attack on Ukraine was wrong.","Here's the rewritten text, simplified to CEFR B1 level:

Xi Jinping has a plan for China. He wants China to go in a certain direction. But some people think he is taking China to a new and unknown place.

One big worry is that Xi wants to take over Taiwan. Taiwan is an island near China. Experts do not think this will happen soon.

Last year, China did more military actions near Taiwan than ever before. In August, China said it was ready to use force to take Taiwan.

Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the United States, went to Taiwan. This made China angry. China showed its power by doing more military actions near Taiwan. These actions were very strong.

The United States is important for Taiwan. The US is helping Taiwan more. They might give Taiwan a special status like a friend in NATO. The US will also sell weapons to Taiwan.

Ma Chun-Wei is a professor in Taiwan. He says China cannot fight the US. So, China is doing things to Taiwan and its people.

China might use tricks to confuse people in Taiwan. They might also use computers to attack Taiwan. China could also make it hard for Taiwan to do business. These things could happen before the next election in Taiwan in 2024.

Yun Sun works at a research center in the US. She says China will put more pressure on Taiwan. This will happen if the Democratic Progressive party is in power in Taiwan. This party wants Taiwan to be independent.

On Monday, Taiwan said that many Chinese planes flew near Taiwan. There were 71 planes, including fighter planes and drones. This was the most planes ever seen in one day.

What China is doing to Taiwan is making its relationship with other countries worse.

China is also treating people badly in Hong Kong. They are also hurting people in Xinjiang. The United Nations says this might be a crime against people. This makes the relationship with other countries even worse.

Russia attacked Ukraine. This also made things bad. Xi and Putin, the leader of Russia, said they were good friends. But China did not say that the war in Ukraine was wrong.","Xi Jinping has a plan for China. He calls it ""Xi Jinping Thought."" But some people think his plan is taking China in a new and risky direction.

One of Xi's biggest plans is to take over Taiwan. Taiwan is an island that governs itself. Some experts do not think China will attack Taiwan soon.

Last year, China's military did more near Taiwan than ever before. In August, China said it might use force to take Taiwan.

Nancy Pelosi, a leader from the United States, visited Taiwan. This made China angry. China showed its power by sending more military planes and ships near Taiwan.

The United States is important for Taiwan. The US is giving more support to Taiwan. They might call Taiwan a ""non-major Nato ally."" The US is also selling weapons to Taiwan.

Ma Chun-Wei is a professor in Taiwan. He says China cannot fight the US. So, China is showing its anger towards Taiwan and its people.

China might use tricks to influence Taiwan before its next election in 2024. They might use fake news online or pressure Taiwan's economy.

Yun Sun is an expert on China. She says China will put more pressure on Taiwan. This will happen as long as the Democratic Progressive party is in power in Taiwan. This party wants Taiwan to be independent.

On Monday, Taiwan said that many Chinese planes flew near the island. There were 71 planes, including fighter jets. This was the most planes ever reported at one time.

China's actions towards Taiwan have made Xi's relationship with the West worse.

China's actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang have also caused problems. China is treating people unfairly in these places. The United Nations says China's actions in Xinjiang might be crimes against humanity.

Russia attacked Ukraine. This also made things worse. Xi and Vladimir Putin, the leader of Russia, said they were good friends. But China did not say that Russia's attack was wrong.",0.7925284504890442,0.5,74.31446537900877,1.0,0.7431446537900877,0.6785577014263774,0.8408776521682739,0.6666666666666666,75.18528149386849,0.9953679626532879,0.7504632037346712,0.7526691741898706,0.813957691192627,0.8,70.90046153846156,0.8524884615384611,0.6647511538461539,0.7595696150129271
"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”. Zero-Covid restrictions and the near collapse of the property development sector punished China’s economy this year.","The war in Ukraine is a problem for Xi. It makes things hard for him in the world.
He is friends with Putin, but he does not want problems with other countries.
He does not want to have rules against Russia that will hurt China.
China and Russia both want to be important in Central Asia. They both want to trade there.

In March, America said Putin asked China for weapons. China did not give him weapons.
But China helped Russia in other ways. They helped with news stories and false information.
They also tried to stop other countries from putting rules on Russia.
Chinese people said they agreed with the war. The armies of China and Russia did exercises together.

Chinese diplomats made trouble too. This made things bad for Xi with other countries.
In England, some Chinese diplomats hurt a man who was protesting for Hong Kong.
They went back to China and did not talk to the police in England.

But it is important for Xi to have good relationships with other countries.
He talked to many leaders of countries, like Joe Biden.
Xi wants people to think better of China. He wants to change the way people see his government.

Maya Wang says that Xi's actions will test other countries.
She worries that some countries will be nicer to China.
She thinks they might stop caring about human rights in China.

Right now, countries are still strict with China.
America is making rules about China's computer chip business.
Japan and the Netherlands may also make these rules.
This will make it hard for Xi to help China's economy.

Tsang says that these rules could hurt China's economy a lot.
China's economy was bad this year because of Covid rules and problems with houses.","The war in Ukraine is a problem for China's leader, Xi. It makes his position difficult in the world. The war is still happening.

Xi has a friendship with Putin, the leader of Russia. But he does not want problems with other countries. He wants to avoid rules against Russia. China and Russia also compete for power in Asia. They both want to control trade routes.

In March, the US said Putin asked China for weapons. China did not give weapons. But China has helped Russia in other ways. They seem to work together to spread information. They also try to stop other countries from punishing Russia.

Chinese leaders have said they agree with Russia's actions. The armies of China and Russia have practiced fighting together.

Chinese diplomats have also caused problems. In England, some Chinese diplomats hurt a protester. They were sent back to China. This made Xi's relationship with other countries worse.

But Xi cares about relationships with other countries. He started a new term as leader. He has talked to many leaders, like Joe Biden from the US.

One person said Xi wants to make China look better. He wants to change China's image.

Other people are watching to see what happens. They are worried that countries will be nicer to China. They think some countries might stop worrying about human rights in China.

For now, many countries are still strict with China. The US is making new rules about China's technology. Other countries may join these rules. This could make it harder for China's economy to get better.

One expert said these rules could hurt China's economy a lot.

China's economy has had problems this year. Rules about Covid and problems with houses have made things difficult.","The war in Ukraine has made things hard for Xi Jinping. He is the leader of China. The war has created problems for him in the world.

Xi wants to stay friends with Putin, the leader of Russia. But he does not want to be punished with rules against Russia. China and Russia also compete for power in Asia. They both want to control trade in that area.

America said that Putin asked China for weapons. China did not give weapons to Russia. But China has helped Russia in other ways. They seem to work together to spread news. China also tries to stop rules against Russia.

Chinese leaders have said they agree with Russia's actions in Ukraine. The armies of China and Russia have practiced fighting together.

Chinese diplomats have also caused problems for Xi. A Chinese diplomat in England hurt a person who was protesting for democracy in Hong Kong. This made China's relationship with other countries worse.

But Xi still cares about global relationships. After he became leader for the third time, he talked to many leaders. He spoke with Joe Biden, the leader of America.

A person named Cohen says Xi is trying to make China look better. China has been acting too strong and causing problems.

Xi is trying to be friendly. But people are watching to see what he does. They have been worried about human rights in China.

Maya Wang from Human Rights Watch says some countries might become nicer to China. They might stop worrying about human rights.

For now, countries are still being tough on China. America is making rules against China's computer chip industry. Japan and the Netherlands will probably do the same. This will cause problems for China's economy. Xi wants to make the economy better.

"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone. A faltering economy could further provoke domestic frustrations, which peaked in 2022 over the impact of Xi’s signature hardline zero-Covid policy. For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled. With no more lockdowns, quarantine, travel restrictions or mass testing, Covid cases have soared across China. Mass fatalities are predicted, with estimates of up to a million people dying from the virus.","The government in China wants to fix the problem with buildings falling down. They will give money to help. The amount is 1.4 trillion yuan. This is like 166 billion British pounds.

Experts think this money will help builders start working again. They can build more things. This might help China's economy.

But China also has other problems. The zero-Covid policy hurt the economy. Now, there will be more sick people. This could make the economy worse.

People in China might be angry. They were very angry in 2022 because of the zero-Covid policy.

For two years, the zero-Covid policy helped most people live normally. It also kept the number of deaths low.

But then, a new type of Covid called Omicron came. It spread very fast. It made the economy and people's lives difficult.

People did not like the sudden lockdowns. The lockdowns were not managed well. There were also some accidents. These made people even more angry.

Some people died in a bus crash. Other people died in a fire in Xinjiang. The building was locked down.

People started to protest. These were the biggest protests since 1989. People were angry about the zero-Covid rules. They also complained about censorship. Some people did not like the leader, Xi.

The protests showed some people what the government did to minorities and people who disagreed with them.

One expert, Cohen, said that people now know the government does not always follow its own rules.

The police stopped the protests quickly. But the protests seemed to make a difference. After one week, the zero-Covid policy ended. Many people thought it would last much longer.

Now, there are no more lockdowns. There is no more quarantine. People can travel again. There is no more mass testing. But now, many people are getting sick with Covid.

Experts think many people will die. They say maybe one million people will die from the virus.","The Chinese government wants to help with buildings that are not finished. These buildings stopped being built. The government is giving 1.4 trillion yuan (166 billion pounds) to start building again. Experts think this will help builders start working more. They also think it will help China's economy.

But the government has other problems. The ""zero-Covid"" policy caused problems for the economy. Now, the policy is gone, and there will be more sick people. A weak economy could make people angry. In 2022, people were very angry about the zero-Covid policy.

For two years, China had a plan. This plan let people live normally and kept people from dying. But then a new kind of Covid came. It was called Omicron. It made the plan fail. This caused problems for the economy and for people.

People did not like the lockdowns. The lockdowns were sudden and not well done. People started to protest. Some sad things happened, like a bus crash and a fire. These things made people even angrier.

These were the biggest protests in China since 1989. People were mostly angry about the zero-Covid policy. They also complained about not being allowed to say what they thought. Some people were against the leader, Xi.

The protests made some Chinese people see how the government treats other people. These people are minorities or people who disagree with the government. One person, Cohen, said that people now know the government does not always follow its own rules. The government says it wants to follow the rules.

The police stopped the protests quickly. But the protests seemed to work. After one week, the zero-Covid policy ended. Many people thought this policy would last for a long time.

"On Monday, in his first remarks on Covid since the shift in policy, Xi urged officials to take steps to “feasibly protect people’s lives” and said: “We should launch the patriotic health campaign in a more targeted way ... fortify a community line of defence for epidemic prevention and control, and feasibly protect people’s lives, safety and health.” Trivium says what happens next with Covid and Covid policy is “the most important question” politically and economically, for China and Xi in 2023: “It’s not at all clear how this plays out.” The past year has brought far more for China than Xi would have hoped, or analysts expected. Tsang says that, in the end, events have still largely worked out for Xi, even if protests took the shine off his leadership. “He mostly got what he wanted, including not just a third term as top leader but also a leadership filled by his supporters,” says Tsang. “It is less clear that it was equally good for China, as Xi’s amassing of near dictatorial power is costing China dearly.” Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

A group called Trivium says Covid is very important. Covid and the rules about it are important for China in 2023. They are important for Xi too. It is not clear what will happen next.

"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is getting ready. Covid may come to the countryside soon. This may happen in early 2023.

A company called Airfinity thinks the Covid wave will hit the countryside in late winter. Many people may get sick. More people may get sick than in the cities now.

The Chinese government is now saying something different about Covid. Before, they said Covid was very bad. Now, they say it is like a cold.

The person on WeChat from Henan said that his town is talking differently. They say everyone has a cold. They say there is nothing to fear.

"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","Here is the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

"Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island’s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan’s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday – the largest reported incursion to date. “As long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,” President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. “Taiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.” The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China’s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said “a few things” had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan’s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine’s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance.","Taiwan will make its military service longer. Now, people must serve in the military for four months. Soon, they will need to serve for one year.

This is because there are problems with China. China is making military actions against Taiwan. The president of Taiwan made this announcement.

The new plan will start in 2024. People in the military will have better training. They will learn how to shoot. They will learn combat like soldiers in the United States.

The soldiers will guard important places. This will help the army to act faster if China tries to attack.

Recently, many Chinese planes flew near Taiwan. The defence ministry said 71 planes and drones came close. This was the most planes ever recorded.

The president, Tsai Ing-wen, spoke about this. She said Taiwan must be strong. Then Taiwan can stay a place for democracy and freedom. It will not become a place of war.

She also said Taiwan believes in democracy, not dictatorship. Taiwan wants peace, not war. She asked people to be brave and protect Taiwan.

The government will also pay soldiers more money. Now, they get about 6,500 Taiwan dollars a month. That is like 211 US dollars. Soon, they will get 26,307 Taiwan dollars. That is like 856 US dollars. This is close to the minimum wage.

Since 2013, men over 18 had to serve four months. They spent five weeks in basic training. The new plan will make basic training eight weeks long.

The mayor of Kaohsiung city, Chen Chi-mai, said it is important to make Taiwan safer.

Taiwan used to have many soldiers. Now, it has more volunteer soldiers. But China is becoming stronger and wants Taiwan. Russia attacked Ukraine. This made people think about how to make Taiwan stronger.

Tsai said they learned from the war in Ukraine. They are using this to change Taiwan's defense. Ukraine fought against Russia, which is a bigger country. This gave other countries time to help Ukraine.","Taiwan will make changes to its military service. Right now, young men must serve in the military for four months. This will change to one year.

The change is because of problems with China. China and Taiwan have disagreements. Taiwan is worried about a possible attack from China.

This new plan will start in 2024. The soldiers will have harder training. They will learn to shoot better. They will also learn combat skills like soldiers in the United States.

The soldiers will protect important places. This will help the main army be ready if China attacks.

The leader of Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen, spoke about this. She said that if Taiwan is strong, it will protect freedom. She said Taiwan chooses democracy, not dictatorship. Taiwan wants peace, not war. She wants everyone to be brave and protect Taiwan.

The government will also pay the soldiers more money. Now, they get about $211 each month. Soon, they will get about $856 each month. This is close to the lowest salary someone can earn in Taiwan.

Now, new soldiers train for five weeks. With the new plan, they will train for eight weeks.

The mayor of Kaohsiung city said it is important to make Taiwan safer. He said this is because of the problems with China.

Taiwan was changing to a military with only volunteers. But now, because China is stronger, Taiwan needs more soldiers. The war in Ukraine also made Taiwan think about its defense.

"Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan’s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. “The United States’ commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was “getting more serious than ever”, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island’s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi’s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island’s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers “a better living environment” for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office.

"Kherson city was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November. But for some, the horrors of the Russian occupation are still not over. Nadia* sent her 14-year-old son to a Russian-run summer camp in Crimea – occupied by Moscow since 2014 – in October. He was meant to return after two weeks. It has now been more than two months. In late November, he forwarded her a series of chilling voice messages from his camp leader telling him he would not be allowed back to Kherson because of his pro-Ukraine views. “You are in Russia! You shouldn’t be doing different [types] of weird bullshit,” the camp leader in Yevpatoria, Crimea, said in the voice messages, which have been forwarded to the Guardian. “I don’t know who is going to deal with you now, but you are not going back to Kherson, that’s 100% [certain] … You can thank your mother for that.” Like many parents, Nadia did not see sending her child to such a camp – known as summer camps even at other times of year – as making a pro-Russia statement. Parents often decided to send their children because their classmates were going and they were being offered a free holiday by the sea. Nadia’s son left Kherson on 4 October and his stay at the camp was repeatedly extended by the authorities, said his mother, speaking from central Kherson after Russian forces left the city. At first, the camp leaders told her that this was for safety reasons and then, after Ukrainian forces had entered Kherson city, they said he could not return because the city was now “occupied” by Ukraine. In the messages, the camp leader outlined his problem with the boy. Firstly, his Telegram profile picture featured a Ukrainian trident, Ukraine’s national symbol, on the wall in the background. Secondly, his mother had said she wanted her son to return to Ukraine, signifying that she saw Kherson city as part of Ukraine, not Russia, thereby going against the grain of Russian propaganda that still insists the city is part of Russia. Nadia’s case is one of many. Hundreds of Ukrainian children as young as six and as old as 16 from Kherson and Kharkiv regions have been stuck in Russian summer camps for weeks and in some cases months.","Kherson is a city in Ukraine. Ukrainian soldiers took back Kherson in November. But some people are still having problems.

Nadia sent her son to a summer camp. Her son is 14 years old. The camp was in Crimea. Russia has controlled Crimea since 2014.

Nadia's son went to the camp in October. He was supposed to come back after two weeks. But he did not come back. It has been more than two months.

In November, Nadia got messages from the camp leader. The messages were voice messages. The camp leader said her son could not go back to Kherson. The camp leader said her son likes Ukraine.

The camp leader said, ""You are in Russia! You should not do bad things."" The camp leader was in Yevpatoria, Crimea. He also said, ""You are not going back to Kherson. You can thank your mother for that."" Nadia sent these messages to a newspaper.

Many parents sent their children to these camps. They did not think it was a bad thing. The camps were free and by the sea. Other children were going too.

Nadia's son left Kherson on October 4. The camp said he could stay longer. At first, they said it was for safety. Then, Ukrainian soldiers took back Kherson. The camp said he could not come back because Ukraine ""occupied"" the city.

The camp leader said he had problems with Nadia's son. The boy had a picture of a Ukrainian symbol on his phone. It was a trident. Also, Nadia wanted her son to come back to Ukraine. This meant she thought Kherson was part of Ukraine. Russia says Kherson is part of Russia.

Nadia is not the only one with this problem. Many Ukrainian children are stuck in Russian summer camps. Some children are six years old. Some are sixteen. They are from Kherson and Kharkiv.

The camp leader had problems with the boy. One problem was his picture on Telegram. Telegram is a messaging app. His picture showed a Ukrainian symbol. The symbol is called a trident. It was on a wall in the background.

Another problem was that Nadia wanted her son to return to Ukraine. This meant she thought Kherson was part of Ukraine. Russia says Kherson is part of Russia. So, Nadia was against what Russia was saying.

"Over the summer, Russia offered parents in the occupied areas of Ukraine a chance to send their children to summer camps in Crimea and southern Russia for free. But it has been refusing to return the children to their parents, citing the ongoing fighting as well as Ukraine’s “occupation” of areas Russia claimed to have annexed and has now retreated from. Parents are told they can collect the children if they come in person, which requires them to cross the dangerous unofficial checkpoint through the frontline or leave Ukraine and travel via Poland and the Baltics. But many of the parents are from very low-income backgrounds and have not been able to make the journey. Though the parents sent them willingly, they had agreed to a short stint. The UN convention on children’s rights bans the “illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad”, so Russia is obliged to return the children. The Guardian spoke to eight parents who had sent their children to the summer camps. Some say they believe that Russia wants to use the children to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. Others believe Moscow wants to assimilate the children and plan to keep them in Russia. The camps were advertised through schools in the occupied areas as restorative breaks, offering a mix of sports, arts, games, and sea air or lake swimming. But the children have also been taught Russian narratives about the invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Soviet history as well as Russian culture, according to several interviewed and videos posted online. In one video, hundreds of children can be seen in a school playground in Crimea singing the Russian national anthem. Most appear not to know the words. The hundreds of children stuck in the Russian-run summer camps are in addition to the thousands of children living in orphanages in the occupied areas who were illegally taken to Russia during the Russian occupation. Ukraine’s human right’s ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, has said this is part of Russia’s “genocide against Ukraine”, erasing Ukrainian identity through “re-educating the future generations”. Lubinets said the Russians were not interested in returning the children, and though Ukraine was trying, “the return of each child is like a special operation”. Ukraine asks parents not to publicly name their children as they then become harder to exchange.","In the summer, Russia said that children from Ukraine could go to summer camps. The camps were in Crimea and Russia. The camps were free for the parents.

But now, Russia is not sending the children back home. Russia says the fighting is still happening. Russia also says that Ukraine is ""occupying"" some areas. Russia used to control these areas, but now they don't.

Russia tells the parents they can get their children. But the parents must go to Russia in person. They need to cross a dangerous checkpoint. Or, they must leave Ukraine and travel through Poland. They also need to travel through the Baltics.

Many parents do not have much money. They cannot make this trip. The parents let their children go to the camps. But they thought the children would only stay for a short time.

There is a UN rule about children. It says that countries cannot take children to other countries and not send them back. So, Russia should send the children back.

The Guardian newspaper talked to eight parents. They sent their children to the summer camps. Some parents think Russia wants to trade the children. They think Russia wants to trade them for Russian soldiers. These soldiers are in prison.

Other parents think Russia wants to keep the children. They think Russia wants to make them Russian.

The camps were shown in schools in Ukraine. The schools were in areas controlled by Russia. The camps were said to be fun. They had sports, art, games, and swimming.

But the children are also learning about Russia. They are learning about Russia's ideas about the war. They are learning about Russian history and culture. This information comes from people who were interviewed and videos online.

In one video, children are singing the Russian national song. This is happening at a school in Crimea. Most of the children do not know the words.

Ukraine asks parents not to say their children's names. If they do, it is harder to get the children back.","In the summer, Russia told parents in Ukraine that their children could go to free summer camps.

"For a domestic audience, Russia portrays the deportation of the children as an attempt to save Ukrainian children from the war – ignoring Russia’s role in starting the conflict. Since October, the children have started attending Russian schools while living on the camps’ premises. It is not clear what plans Russia has for these children beyond this school term. One of them is Natalia’s* 12-year-old daughter, who left her home in Balakliia in late August and is still in southern Russia, attending a school in Krasnodar by bus. Natalia has managed to keep in daily contact with her but cannot afford to make the journey to collect her. “I think it’s some sort of blackmail,” said Natalia. “I think they want to use them as bargaining chips.” In at least some cases, the Russian camp leaders have said they do not plan to send the children back. In other cases, children have been moved from one camp to another without the parents being informed. Ivana*, a mother from Kherson region, made the long journey to collect her daughter from a camp in Crimea, only to be told the child was not there any more and had been moved to a camp in the Republic of Adygea. She then made a second long trip, where eventually she found her. * * * Exactly how many Ukrainian children remain in Russian hands is very difficult to tell. In mid-October, Russia’s state news agency Tass said there were about 4,500 children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Crimean summer camps. Natalia said at least 100 of those who travelled with her daughter were still there. Recent videos taken from some of the five camps in Crimea hosting children from Kherson indicate that at least several hundred children are still there. Part of the issue is that many of the parents refuse to come forward to the Ukrainian authorities. Dmytro*, who managed to get his son back by threatening a teacher into putting him on a bus in early October, said parents he knew feared being labelled as collaborators or supporters of Russia. They were trying to resolve things on their own, he said, without official help.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

"An adviser to the new Kherson regional authorities on missing people, Volodymyr Zhdanov, questioned how the parents “could give their children to the occupiers”, though he admitted it was a grey area and the full picture was unclear. “We are hearing a lot of stories through the grapevine [of children stuck in Crimea],” said Zhdanov, who noted that the gathering of information on what had happened in occupied Kherson was only just beginning. “But the police say parents have not come forward.” Andrii Kovanyi, a spokesperson for Kherson police, said they could not comment on the matter as it was being dealt with by several bodies. Most parents and children who attended the camps said the conditions were good. Children were given the equivalent of hotel rooms to share, taken to see dolphins, to museums and to the beach. The Russian-appointed authorities in Crimea claim to have spent 1.2bn rubles (£16.4m) in 2022 on the camps, which were also attended by Russian children. The idea behind the camps appears to be to demonstrate the best of Russia and to integrate the children into their new state. In interviews, the adults in charge portray themselves and others as saving children who are victims of the war as well as the Ukrainian state. In videos from the children’s camps posted on the Russian-installed Kherson authority’s social media, children can be seen with the Russian flag, singing the Russian national anthem as well as classic Soviet songs. A nine-year-old girl in Kherson city, whose mother collected her in October, said that as well as games and sports they had lectures “about the war”. One history teacher from Kherson, Maksym Ivchenko, who like many other teachers accompanied the children to Crimea, was asked by Russia’s Crimea24 TV to explain how the history curriculum in Russia differed from that of Ukraine. “The most egregious thing was the reversal of modern history.

"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president was speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, where Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were reportedly present. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine.","It is almost 9 pm in Kyiv.

Here is what is happening:

Officials in Ukraine are telling people to leave the city of Kherson. Russian soldiers are attacking Kherson with bombs.

Kherson was freed from Russian control not long ago. Some people in Kherson do not want to leave. They lived there when Russia controlled the city. Now, it is dangerous because of the bombs. A local official is helping people to leave.

The Ukrainian army said that Russian soldiers shot 33 rockets at Kherson in one day. The rockets hit places where normal people live.

On Tuesday night, Russian soldiers bombed a hospital in Kherson. They hit the part of the hospital where babies are born. Kyrylo Tymoshenko said this. He works for the President.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that only a few people are still in the city of Bakhmut. Bakhmut is in the east of Ukraine. It is a dangerous city.

Zelenskiy said that everywhere in Bakhmut is covered in blood. Ukrainian soldiers are fighting there. The fighting is very hard and shows how cruel the war is.

One staff member told reporters: I don’t even want to think about [what could have happened]’ after surgeons were in theatre just 30 minutes earlier. The secret to Igor Pedin’s survival had been his invisibility, the 61-year-old had said. With his dog, Zhu-Zhu, the former ship’s cook banked on being ignored by the trigger-happy Russian soldiers and their killing machines when he took the first step of a 140-mile journey from his home in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on 23 April, before stealing out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories towards the relative safety in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Such were the risks that soldiers at one checkpoint had beseeched Pedin to turn back but then stuffed cigarettes in his pockets for good luck. He did survive, against the odds, but the remarkable story has made Pedin more visible than he could ever have imagined. Read the full story here: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Kherson city council member, Dmytro Poddubniy, told CNN: I’m telling these people that Kherson is one of the most dangerous cities right now. So I ask them to imagine that they are going on vacation for a couple of weeks. It may be easier for them to decide to move this way. But still, a lot of people are staying in the city. One Kherson resident, Inna Balyoha, told the news channel she was afraid her elderly and sick mother would not be able to endure the journey. She said: She is very weak. She will not reach another city. Many remain in Kherson under shelling because of their parents. Authorities have urged Kherson residents to evacuate to safer regions as Russian shelling has become “more and more frequent and large-scale”.","Here is the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

"A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow-installed court in the Russian-annexed peninsula found her guilty of carrying an explosive device, in a trial rights activists have described as “trumped-up” and “illegal”. Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. The Crimean human rights activist, nurse and citizen journalist was detained by Russian authorities in late April while on her way from work. Her family told CNN at the time balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit searched her house in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya, and took the family’s laptops and phones. Her case was part of a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Russian-occupied Crimea. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) called on Russian authorities in Crimea to disclose any information concerning Danilovich’s whereabouts when she first went missing. In a statement, Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said: Iryna Danilovich’s alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press. Russia’s security service (FSB) accused Danilovich of making an explosive device and keeping it on her person, IMI said. She was also fined 50,000 rubles (£570) on the charges of illegal storage and manufacture of explosives under Part 1 of Art. 222.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, it said.

"Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. One of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to a Russian-installed “official”. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov.

"Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. The mother of an Australian man from Victoria killed fighting in Ukraine has remembered her son as a defender of freedom who was driven by empathy. The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher”, it added.

"Still, Bakhmut stands. Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000, is a ghost town now largely in ruins. The deterioration of diplomatic relations between Russia and Lithuania has continued, with the expulsion today of a Lithuanian from their embassy in Moscow. A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: On 28 December, Chargé d’Affaires of Lithuania in Russia, Jurgita Cibulskiene was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Lithuanian side was strongly protested in connection with the unjustified expulsion on 1 December this year [of an] employee of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. As a response, one of the diplomats of the Lithuanian embassy was declared “persona non grata”, and must leave the territory of the Russian Federation within five days. Reuters reported that ship insurers have said they are cancelling war risk cover across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, after an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses. Reinsurers, which insure the insurers, typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on 1 January, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started. The moves by the insurers will make it harder for ship-owners or charterers to find insurance, increase prices and may mean some ships sail uninsured, industry sources said. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, has tweeted images of a maternity hospital in Kherson city that was shelled by Russian forces yesterday. According to Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Two babies were born at the hospital the day of the attack, Liashko wrote on his Facebook, adding that one arrived just “minutes” before the shelling. He added: Fortunately, no babies ... no hospital staff were hurt this time. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The European Commission says it is donating €14m (£12.3m) to buy and transport school buses for Ukraine, as well as an additional 120 buses “to bring Ukrainian children safely to school”.","Bakhmut is still there. Before the war, about 70,000 to 80,000 people lived in Bakhmut. Now, it is almost empty and destroyed.

Russia said that on December 28, they spoke to Jurgita Cibulskiene, who is in charge of the Lithuanian embassy in Russia.

Russia was angry because Lithuania kicked out a Russian embassy worker on December 1.

So, Russia is kicking out a Lithuanian diplomat. This diplomat must leave Russia in five days.

Reuters says that companies that give insurance to ships are stopping their war insurance in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.

These insurance companies are stopping because the companies that insure them lost a lot of money. These big insurance companies renew their contracts every year on January 1. This is their first chance to stop insuring things since the war in Ukraine started.

It will be harder for ship owners to find insurance now. The prices will go up. Some ships may not have insurance at all.

**Ship Insurance**

Some companies that give insurance to ships are stopping their insurance in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. These companies are losing a lot of money.

Companies that insure the insurance companies are also leaving. They will not renew their contracts after January 1.

This means it will be harder for ships to find insurance. The price of insurance will also go up. Some ships might sail without any insurance.

After the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukraine’s parliament passed a “decommunisation” law that meant statues to Lenin and other Soviet political figures had to be removed (or, in the case of Odesa’s Lenin statue, reworked and reimagined as a statue to Darth Vader). Since Russia’s February invasion, however, many in Ukraine have sought a more overarching reevaluation of anything Russian, and the monument to Catherine had been daubed with red paint several times. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Authorities plan to store the monuments in a museum in the city. France’s armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has tweeted a photo of him visiting a memorial to the war dead in Kyiv as part of his visit to Ukraine. Lecornu, who is on his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May, is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army officials. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, has struck a cautious tone on whether his country would supply Ukraine with air defence systems. Speaking in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Crosetto said the air defence systems, which Ukraine’s president has requested, would be provided to Kyiv “if possible”. He added: If we give air defence missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality.","Here's the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level:

The war in Ukraine is hurting many children. About six million children who go to school are affected. Many schools are broken or destroyed.

In the city of Odesa, people are taking down a big statue. The statue is of Catherine the Great. She was a Russian leader who started the city a long time ago.

The statue was built in 1900. Then, it was taken down in 1920. Later, it was put back up in 2007.

Some years ago, Ukraine made a new law. The law said that statues of old Soviet leaders must be removed. A statue of Lenin in Odesa was changed into a statue of Darth Vader.

Now, after Russia invaded Ukraine, many people want to remove anything that is Russian. The statue of Catherine was painted red many times.

Last month, the city voted to take down the statue. They will also take down a statue of a general named Alexander Suvorov. The statues will be kept in a museum in the city.

In a tweet posted after the call, Ukraine’s leader said Meloni informed him that “the issue of providing air defence systems to protect Ukrainian skies is being considered”. A Swiss court has granted a six-month “stay of bankruptcy” to the company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was built to bring Russian gas to Germany but never opened after Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, a Swiss-based company owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom, built the gas pipeline but the project was halted in early February after Moscow formally recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. The company’s stay has now been extended to 10 July by a Swiss regional, Reuters cited a notice published in the Swiss official gazette of commerce as saying. Russian soldiers mobilised to fight in Ukraine will be able to store their frozen sperm in a cryobank for free, a leading Russian lawyer has said. The Russian Union of Lawyers head, Igor Trunov, told the state-owned news agency Tass the health ministry had agreed to his appeal to offer free cryobank services to the 300,000 soldiers conscripted in September. According to the lawyer, his organisation has already been contacted by several couples whose husbands will soon depart for Ukraine. The health ministry has not yet commented on Trunov’s remarks. Demographers have warned that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and its “partial” military mobilisation could further deepen Russia’s demographic crisis. Russia’s population has been in near-constant decline for decades. The coronavirus pandemic led to the country’s largest natural population decline since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war in Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of young Russian men while also sparking an unprecedented exodus of educated professionals, is expected to hasten the demographic crash for Russia. The independent demographer Alexei Raksha has described the current demographic situation as “the perfect storm”. Earlier we reported air raid alerts blared across Ukraine, including in Kyiv and Mykolaiv.","Okay, here is the rewritten text, simplified for CEFR A2 level.

**Crosetto and Meloni**

Volodymyr Zelenskiy talked to Giorgia Meloni on Tuesday. Zelenskiy is the leader of Ukraine. Meloni is the leader of Italy. After the talk, Zelenskiy wrote a message. He said Meloni told him Italy is thinking about giving Ukraine weapons. These weapons would help protect Ukraine from air attacks.

**Nord Stream 2 Pipeline**

There is a company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. This pipeline was made to bring gas from Russia to Germany. But the pipeline is not open. Vladimir Putin told his soldiers to go to Ukraine. After this, the pipeline project stopped. A court in Switzerland has given the company more time. It is called a ""stay of bankruptcy."" This means the company does not have to pay its debts right now. The company has six more months. The company is called Nord Stream 2 AG. It is owned by Gazprom, a big gas company in Russia.

**Free Sperm Storage for Soldiers**

Russian soldiers are going to fight in Ukraine. They can store their sperm for free. This is in a special place called a cryobank. A cryobank keeps sperm frozen. A lawyer in Russia said this. His name is Igor Trunov. He asked the health ministry to do this. The health ministry said yes. This is for soldiers who were called up in September. There are 300,000 of them. Some couples have already asked about this. Their husbands are going to Ukraine soon. The health ministry has not said anything about this yet.

**Russia's Population Problem**

Russia has a problem with its population. Not enough people are being born. Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine is making this problem worse. Many young Russian men have died in the war. Also, many educated people are leaving Russia. This will make the population problem worse. An expert named Alexei Raksha said the situation is very bad. He called it ""the perfect storm.""

A court in Switzerland made a decision. The decision helps the company that built Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 is a pipeline. It was built to send gas from Russia to Germany. But it never opened. This is because Vladimir Putin sent soldiers to Ukraine.

The company that built the pipeline is called Nord Stream 2 AG. It is in Switzerland. It belongs to Gazprom. Gazprom is a big Russian gas company. The project stopped in February. This happened after Russia said two parts of Ukraine were independent.

Now, the court has given the company more time. They have until July 10. This information was in a Swiss paper. Reuters news agency reported this.

Russian soldiers are going to fight in Ukraine. They can keep their sperm frozen for free. This will be in a special bank called a cryobank. A Russian lawyer said this.

Experts say there is a problem with the number of people in Russia. Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine can make this worse. Russia has had fewer people for many years.

The coronavirus made the problem bigger. It was the biggest drop in population since 1991.

The war in Ukraine is also a problem. Many young Russian men have died. Also, many educated people have left Russia. This will make the population problem worse.

Experts who study population changes are worried. They say Putin's war in Ukraine and the calling up of soldiers could make Russia's population problem worse.

Russia's population has been decreasing for many years. The coronavirus pandemic caused the biggest drop in population since 1991, when the Soviet Union ended.

The war in Ukraine has caused many young Russian men to die. Also, many educated people have left the country. This is expected to make Russia's population decrease even faster.

"Officials have sounded the all-clear almost two hours later. There were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian social media suggested the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine, forcing hundreds of civilians to flee the recently liberated city amid relentless shelling by Moscow’s troops. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said this morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in the city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. No one was hurt and the staff and patients had been moved to a shelter, he added. At least 10 people were killed and 58 were wounded by a Russian strike in Kherson on Saturday, authorities said. Russian forces were forced to withdraw from Kherson city last month, but its residents have faced relentless Russian shelling from the east bank of the Dnieper River. About 400 people have fled Kherson since Christmas Day, the BBC reported, after a sharp increase in the intensity of the Russian bombardment of the city. The Kremlin has dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, and insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There can be no peace plan for Ukraine that does not take into account today’s realities regarding Russian territory, with the entry of four regions into Russia. Plans that do not take these realities into account cannot be peaceful. Russia illegally annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk and Donetsk – in September after holding Kremlin-orchestrated fake referendums. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions. Kyiv and its western allies have said they would never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine’s territory.","Here's the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

Russian soldiers had to leave Kherson city last month. But they are still shooting at the city. They are on the other side of the Dnieper River. Many people have left Kherson since Christmas. About 400 people have left. This is because Russia is shooting at the city more often now.

Dmitry Peskov speaks for the Russian government. He said there can be no peace plan if it does not agree that four Ukrainian areas belong to Russia now. If a plan does not agree with this, it is not a good plan for peace.

Russia took four areas of Ukraine in September. These areas are Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk. Russia said that the people in these areas voted to join Russia. But the vote was not real. It was organized by Russia. Russia does not have full control over these four areas.

It is his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May 2022. France24 reporter Andrew Hilliar has said Lecornu is expected to visit a memorial to the war dead today, and that the trip comes on the back of the promise by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to increase his nation’s military support for Ukraine. Hilliar reports that Lecornu is under pressure to announce further assistance, with some in Ukraine still angry at Macron’s comments during the course of the war, where he has seemed more vocal than most European leaders to suggest that Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions in return for peace. Reuters reports that one of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head ofRussia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed “official” in the occupied region.

"The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has tweeted to reiterate the support the US is providing to keep energy systems running in Ukraine, following Russia’s sustained attacks on the energy infrastructure that civilians rely on. The ambassador said the embassy in Kyiv is “proud to carry out the secretary of state’s mission to work day and night with Ukrainian partners to help keep the energy grid up and running through the winter. We stand with Ukraine.” Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. Associated Press reports that in an interview with the minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian official said: The next stage, now that we are more or less equipped with reconnaissance drones, is strike drones. These are both exploding drones and drones that fly up to 3 to 10km and hit targets. I can say already that the situation regarding drones will change drastically in February or March. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. In the last few moments, authorities in Kyiv and Mykolaiv have declared air raid alerts, according to posts on Telegram. The state-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting that Russian authorities claim to have thwarted a Ukrainian-sponsored terrorist attack in Chegem in the Kabardino-Balkarian republic, which is near Russia’s border with Georgia. It reports: The federal security service stopped the activities of two previously convicted Russian citizens who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, were preparing a terrorist act in the city of Chegem. After committing the crime, they planned to leave for Ukraine to take part in hostilities against the Russian armed forces. At the scene of the clash, they found an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2kg in TNT equivalent, an AK-74 assault rifle, a pistol and ammunition. The report states that the two suspects were killed. No evidence was offered for the claims of the Russian security services.","Here's the rewritten text at an A2 level:

The Australian department of foreign affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died.

The European Union delegation to Ukraine has announced that it will support “more than 700,000 Ukrainians in the winter” during the war. In a press statement released on Wednesday, the office of the international organisation for migration (IOM) in Ukraine says it is “stepping up efforts to help internally displaced and war-affected people survive the cold weather”. The statement claims that: IOM’s winter preparedness support, made possible by EU funding, includes repairs to collective centres for displaced people, improvements to water, drainage and heating systems, repairs to damaged houses, and the provision of warm blankets, bedding, mattresses and hygiene items. The programme also provides solid fuel and cash assistance to help people have flexible winter livelihoods. This funding will also enable IOM to ensure the availability of critical assets to ensure that aid continues to reach war-affected populations, and to support partner organisations responding to urgent needs on the ground. Claudia Amaral, head of the European Commission’s directorate-general for civil protection and humanitarian aid in Ukraine, is quoted as saying: Vulnerable sections of the population of Ukraine are going through the hardest winter. As the attacks continue, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating and water, our humanitarian partners, including IOM, continue to work to meet the most urgent needs.

"Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says that fighting has intensified, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops who have been part of a mobilisation drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, the state TASS agency reported on Wednesday. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan. The ministry “determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilised to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024”, Trunov was quoted as saying. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so. More on Russia’s response to the oil price cap, via Reuters: Under the cap, oil traders who want to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. That is close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a price cap on its oil imposed by Western countries, while its forces were involved in heavy fighting around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.","Here's the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

If traders want money from the West, they must follow this rule. They need this money to ship oil around the world.

The price of Russian oil is close to $60 now. But before, Russia sold oil for much more money. This money helped Russia when other countries put rules against them.

Putin wrote a new rule. It says this is because some countries are not friendly. They are doing things that are against the rules of the world. The United States and other countries are doing this.

This new rule will stop Russia from selling oil to these countries. This will start on February 1st and end on July 1st, 2023.

There will also be a rule about oil products like gas. The government will say when this rule starts.

Putin can change these rules if needed.

Western countries put a price limit on Russian oil. Russia is fighting back against this. At the same time, there is heavy fighting in Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine. The city has been bombed and is almost empty.",0.8035587072372437,0.5,89.05928088133241,1.0,0.8905928088133241,0.7313838386835226,0.8138296604156494,0.6666666666666666,80.29636907399204,0.8675907731501991,0.7632409226849801,0.7479124165890987,0.8344094753265381,0.8,79.05367595216703,0.7,0.7005367595216703,0.7783154116160694
"Despite an intensification in the fighting the frontline in eastern Ukraine remains little changed, with neither side making any major advances, said Britain’s Ministry of Defence and Ukraine military analysts. Moscow will ban oil sales to countries that abide by the price cap that was imposed on 5 December, President Vladimir Putin decreed. The price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Moscow’s military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The agency says the actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. The UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) says that since the start of the war, at least 6,884 civilians have been killed in Ukraine, including 429 children. However, the agency believes that the actual figures are “considerably higher”. We’ll have more on this story shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure.","The fighting in eastern Ukraine is very hard. But the place where the soldiers are fighting is almost the same. Britain's Ministry of Defence and Ukrainian experts said this. They said that no one is winning or moving forward much.

Russia will stop selling oil to countries. These countries agreed to a price limit for Russian oil. This limit started on December 5. President Vladimir Putin said this.

This price limit is new. It is even new compared to the Cold War time between the West and Russia. The goal is to make it hard for Russia to fight in Ukraine. But they do not want to stop Russian oil completely, so the market is still working.

The United Nations (UN) has counted people who died in Ukraine. They said that 6,884 people died. This includes 429 children. This is from February 24, 2022, to December 26, 2022. The UN thinks the real number is higher. It is hard to get information from places where the fighting is bad. Some reports are not checked yet.

Hello! Welcome to our news about the war in Ukraine. I am Helen Sullivan. I will tell you what is happening.

The UN said that at least 6,884 people have died in Ukraine since the war started. 429 of these people were children. The UN thinks that the real number of dead people is higher. We will talk more about this soon.

Here are some important things that happened recently:

Russia's President Putin said that Russia will not sell oil to countries that follow the price limit. This starts on February 1, 2023, and will last for five months.

Seven big countries, the European Union, and Australia agreed on the price limit. The limit is $60 for each barrel of Russian oil that comes by sea. This started on December 5.

Ukrainian soldiers are getting closer to taking back Kreminna. Kreminna is a city controlled by Russia in Luhansk. Serhiy Haidai is the governor of Luhansk. He said that soldiers in Kreminna who were controlled by Russia had to go back to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is a town near Kreminna. They went back because the Ukrainian soldiers were pushing them.","The fighting in eastern Ukraine is still strong. But the line where the fighting is happening has not moved much. Neither side has made big steps forward. This information comes from the British Ministry of Defence and experts in Ukraine.

Russia will stop selling oil to countries. These countries agreed to a price limit on Russian oil. This limit started on December 5th. President Vladimir Putin made this decision.

The price limit is new. It did not happen even when the West and the Soviet Union were in the Cold War. The price limit is meant to hurt Russia's military actions in Ukraine. But it also wants to keep the oil market stable by not stopping Russian oil completely.

The United Nations has counted how many normal people have died in the war in Ukraine. They say that 6,884 people have died. This includes 429 children. These deaths happened between February 24, 2022, and December 26, 2022.

The Group of Seven countries, the European Union, and Australia made an agreement this month. They agreed to a price limit of $60 for each barrel of Russian oil that is shipped by sea. This started on December 5th.

Ukrainian soldiers seem to be getting closer to taking back the city of Kreminna. This city is in the Luhansk area and is controlled by Russia. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said that Russian soldiers in Kreminna had to move back to Rubizhne. Rubizhne is a town a few miles to the south-east. They moved because the Ukrainian army was putting pressure on them.","Here's the rewritten text, broken down into simpler sentences and vocabulary, and avoiding complex grammar:

The price limit is new. It is different from the Cold War. The Cold War was between the West and the Soviet Union. The price limit tries to hurt Russia's war effort. It wants to do this without stopping all Russian oil sales.

"Heavy fighting continues in the east and south of the country amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, Britain’s defence ministry said in its daily military briefing on Tuesday. Russia’s military has moved many of its warplanes from Engels airbase to other locations after strikes on the crucial airbase, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force. Three Russian servicemen were killed on Monday after a Ukrainian drone attack on the airbase, which lies deep inside Russian territory, according to Russia’s defence ministry. Putin’s comments that he was “ready to negotiate with all parties” involved in the conflict in Ukraine are part of a deliberate information campaign aimed at misleading the west into making concessions, according to analysts. The US thinktank Institute for the Study of War said the Russian president did not offer to negotiate with Ukraine on Saturday, contrary to some reporting. The bodies of 42 Ukrainian servicemen who died while fighting have been returned to Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government. Work on bringing back the bodies of Ukraine’s fighters “does not stop for a day”, Oleh Kotenko, the commissioner for missing persons, said. Vladimir Putin met his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, twice in the past 24 hours to “finalise many issues”, Belarusian state-owned Belta news agency reported.

"Pope Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, died on Saturday aged 95, three days after his successor, Pope Francis, warned the world that he was gravely ill. The Vatican announced that Francis would preside at Benedict’s funeral in St Peter’s Square on Thursday. From Monday, his body will lie at St Peter’s Basilica to allow the faithful to pay respects. Benedict’s death brings to a close an unprecedented period in recent history where two popes have coexisted, a situation that has caused tensions within rival camps in the Vatican. It eases the way for his successor, Pope Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer paid warm tribute to Benedict, referring to his 2010 visit to the UK as a historic moment. Other world leaders including Ireland’s Michael D Higgins, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Germany’s Olaf Scholz also issued tributes. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, said he was a scholar, pastor and a man of God who would be remembered for “his courtesy, his gentleness, the perceptiveness of his mind and the openness of his welcome to everybody that he met”. Justin Welby, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, said Benedict was “one of the greatest theologians of his age”. Earlier this week, Pope Francis announced during his weekly audience that Benedict was “very sick” and asked for people to pray for him. Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, was a deeply conservative pontiff, whose tenure was overshadowed by sexual abuse scandals in the church. He retired leaving a chequered reputation after a papacy that was at times divisive. The son of a policeman, he grew up in rural Bavaria and at the age of 14 joined the Hitler Youth, a requirement, and served in the German army in the second world war.","Pope Benedict XVI was the leader of the Catholic church. He was the Pope from 2005 to 2013. He stopped being Pope in 2013.

He died on Saturday. He was 95 years old. Pope Francis is the Pope now. He said Benedict was very sick three days before he died.

The Vatican said that Pope Francis will lead Benedict's funeral. The funeral will be in St Peter's Square on Thursday.

"Towards the end of the war, he deserted and was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces. He later became a major figure in the Vatican and, as Cardinal Ratzinger, served as a right-hand man to his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. He headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Vatican department once known as the Inquisition, for 24 years, a position that earned him the nickname “God’s rottweiler”. During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface. His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis, which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005. As well as the flood of allegations, lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests’ complicity in covering it up, the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents, many of which later appeared in an exposé of alleged corruption. In October 2012, a Vatican court convicted the pope’s personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, of stealing the papers. He told the trial he had been acting against “evil and corruption”. Benedict held uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception. He had strongly opposed liberation theology, a radical movement that began in South American in the 1960s and advocated clerical social activism among the poor and marginalised. His sudden resignation at the age of 85, in February 2013, the first pope to do so since the middle ages, left the church reeling. He said at the time that he did not have the strength to carry on as leader of the world’s estimated 1.2 billion Catholics. “I have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me,” he said. He took the title of Pope Emeritus, and pledged to remain “hidden to the world”, devoting himself to private prayer. He retired to in a monastery in Vatican City, where he read, wrote letters and articles, received guests and played the piano. But the former pope remained a powerful conservative influence and a focus for opponents of Francis’s efforts to reform the church and redirect it to serving the poor.","Near the end of the war, he left the army. US soldiers caught him and kept him for a short time.

Later, he became important in the Vatican. The Vatican is the center of the Catholic Church. He was called Cardinal Ratzinger. He worked closely with Pope John Paul II.

He led a department in the Vatican. It was called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It used to be called the Inquisition. He led this department for 24 years. Some people called him ""God's rottweiler"" because he was very strict.

During this time, people began to talk about priests hurting children. They also said the Church was hiding these crimes. Some people said he did not understand how bad the crimes were. They said he did not see how big the problem was. The problem became even bigger after he became pope in 2005.

There were many stories, court cases, and reports about the abuse. They also talked about priests helping to hide the abuse. Some secret papers from the Vatican were stolen. These papers talked about problems like corruption.

In 2012, a court said the Pope's helper, Paolo Gabriele, stole the papers. He said he did it to fight ""evil and corruption.""

Benedict had strong ideas about some things. He did not agree with homosexuality or using birth control. He did not like liberation theology. This was a movement that wanted priests to help poor people.

He suddenly quit being pope in 2013. He was 85 years old. He was the first pope to quit in a long time. This surprised the Church. He said he was not strong enough to lead the Catholic Church anymore. About 1.2 billion people are Catholic. He said he could not do his job well.

He became Pope Emeritus. This means he was pope before, but not anymore. He said he would stay ""hidden to the world."" He would pray in private.

He lived in a monastery in Vatican City. He read, wrote, met people, and played the piano. He still had a lot of influence. Some people who did not like Pope Francis's ideas supported him. Pope Francis wanted to change the Church and help poor people more.","Near the end of the war, he left the army. The US army caught him and kept him as a prisoner for a short time.

Later, he became important in the Vatican, which is the center of the Catholic Church. He became Cardinal Ratzinger. He worked closely with Pope John Paul II before him. He was like the Pope’s helper.

He was in charge of a special group in the Vatican. This group used to be called the Inquisition. He was the head of this group for 24 years. Because of this, people called him ""God’s rottweiler.""

He suddenly quit being Pope in 2013. He was 85 years old. He was the first Pope to quit in a very long time. The church was very surprised. He said he was not strong enough to lead the Catholic Church. There are about 1.2 billion Catholics in the world. He said he could not do his job well anymore.

He became Pope Emeritus. He said he would stay away from the world. He would spend his time praying. He lived in a church building in the Vatican. He read, wrote letters, and played the piano. People visited him.

He was still important. People who did not like Pope Francis's ideas listened to him. Pope Francis wanted to change the church and help poor people more.","Near the end of the war, he left the army. US soldiers caught him and held him for a short time.

Later, he became important in the Vatican. The Vatican is the center of the Catholic Church. He became Cardinal Ratzinger. He worked closely with Pope John Paul II. He was like the Pope's helper.

He was in charge of a Vatican group for 24 years. This group was once called the Inquisition. Some people called him ""God's rottweiler"" because of his strong views.

During this time, people started talking about priests hurting children. They said the church was hiding these crimes. Some people said he did not understand how serious these crimes were. They said he did not understand how big the problem was. The problem got worse after he became Pope in 2005.

There were many stories about the abuse. People sued the church. Official reports talked about the abuse and the priests who hid it.

Also, someone stole secret papers from the Vatican. These papers showed possible bad things happening in the church. In 2012, a court said the Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, stole the papers. He said he did it to fight ""evil and corruption.""

Benedict had strong ideas against homosexuality and using birth control. He also did not like liberation theology. This was a movement in South America. It said priests should help poor people.

He became Pope Emeritus. He said he would stay ""hidden from the world."" He would pray in private. He moved to a monastery in the Vatican. There, he read, wrote, talked to people, and played piano.

But he was still a strong influence. He had old-fashioned ideas. Some people who did not like Pope Francis' changes supported him.

"He repeatedly made his views known through letters, articles and interviews. In April 2019, two months after Francis convened a groundbreaking Vatican conference on sexual abuse, Benedict published a 6,000-word letter saying abuse was a product of a culture of sexual freedom dating from the 1960s. In January 2020, Benedict publicly defended clerical celibacy, as Francis was considering allowing married men to become priests in limited circumstances. “I cannot keep silent,” he wrote in a book, From the Depths of Our Hearts: Priesthood, Celibacy and the Crisis of the Catholic Church, arguing that priestly celibacy protected the mystery of the church. The controversy, which erupted just before The Two Popes – a film about the apparently warm relationship between Benedict and Francis – was aired on Netflix, exposed tensions between rival Vatican camps.

In April 2019, there was a meeting at the Vatican about sexual abuse. This meeting was important. It was organized by Francis. After the meeting, Benedict wrote a long letter.

In January 2020, Benedict talked about priests not getting married. This is called celibacy. Francis was thinking about letting married men become priests. This would only happen in some cases. Benedict did not agree.

He wrote a book. The book was called ""From the Depths of Our Hearts."" In the book, he said priests should not get married. He said celibacy helps the church.

This caused a problem. People disagreed. It happened before a movie came out. The movie was called ""The Two Popes."" The movie was about Francis and Benedict. It showed that they were friends.

Benedict said, “I have to say something.” He wrote a book. The book was called ""From the Depths of Our Hearts."" It was about priests, celibacy, and problems in the church. He said that celibacy keeps the church special.

"As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso remembers excitedly readying himself in front of a handheld meat grinder to crush cashews. It was his part in his family’s annual tradition of preparing a 60-year-old recipe for Christmas cake that had been passed down for generations. Christmas cake – a moist, decadent treat filled with nuts and fruit – usually kicks off the holiday season on the island nation, and for immigrants in the US, has become a way to preserve traditions from back home. Sri Lanka’s Christmas cake is similar to the fruit cake, a quintessentially British dish, but has since evolved from its colonial roots. Like the British version, Christmas cake includes raisins and cherries, but also preserved ginger, the green vegetable chayote (or chow chow, as Sri Lankans call it) in sugar syrup, preserved melon (known as puhul dosi), candied peel, sultanas and aromatics like nutmeg. “It definitely has been adapted to the Sri Lankan palate,” says Cumaraiah-Misso, 34, now a medical student living in Fort Worth, Texas. He still remembers being a child and the earthy aromas of cinnamon and cardamom intermingling with the sweet smell of rose essence while being elbow-deep in a 25-gallon bucket, mixing finely chopped fruit semolina with butter. Marie Shirlene Fernando, 58, a caterer and mother of three living in Cerritos, California, remembers watching her aunt make the cake as a little girl. As a teenager, she took over the responsibility of making the stodgy treat, first for her ailing grandmother and later for her extended family to give as wedding favors. Now, she makes it with her 10-year-old granddaughter for customers across the United States. She carefully wraps the final product in parchment paper and brightly colored cellophane. This year, one of the packages will be shipped to her family in Sri Lanka.","Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso lived in Colombo, Sri Lanka, when he was a child. He remembers Christmas time.

"Given the country’s recent economic and political woes, she hopes the beloved dessert will help evoke unity and remind her mother, sister and extended family, of simpler times of gathering around the table to prepare the cake ingredients. In Sri Lanka, as the country’s hotels gear up for the holiday season, some host cake-mixing parties, where people get a view of culinary staff combining the fruit and nut mixture with the wet ingredients in a custom-built, 9ft-deep barrel. The mix weighs more than 4,000lb. This year, one even took place aboard a naval ship. Fernando said she was watching the Galle Face Hotel’s recent Christmas cake mixing ceremony and thought to herself, “Oh, I’m so glad in spite of all that’s going on, they are still doing it.” These traditions were in jeopardy this year as the nation battled its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Government corruption, financial mismanagement, sluggish economic growth since the pandemic, the depletion of foreign reserves and the war in Ukraine led to widespread blackouts, shortages of essential goods and school closures earlier this year. Islandwide protests ultimately led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the resignation of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. Inflation hit an all-time high of 69.8% in October before dropping slightly to 61% in November. While Fernando is hopeful that the nostalgia of Christmas cake-making will provide some joy to celebrations, Cumaraiah-Misso worries about how the increased prices of ingredients will affect this longstanding tradition. On local Facebook groups, bakers lament the rising cost of ingredients, with some commenting that they have chosen not to make the treat this year and are readying themselves for an “austere Christmas”. In a country ravaged by a 30-year civil war fought on ethnic lines and where, in 2019, at least 290 people died as bombs ripped through three churches on Easter Sunday, Christmas cake can unite across religions. It’s not just the 8% of the country’s Christian population that enjoy it. “There are so many Buddhists, Muslims, friends who I have who are non-Christians.","She wants to make a special cake.

Fernando saw a cake party at a hotel. She was happy that they were still doing it, even though things are bad. Sri Lanka had a very big money problem. It was the worst in a long time.

The government did not do a good job. They had problems with money. The pandemic made things worse. Sri Lanka did not have enough money. The war in Ukraine also caused problems. There were power cuts. People could not get important things. Schools closed.

People protested. The President, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, had to leave. His brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, also left his job. Prices went up a lot.

"They love the Christmas cake, and they wait for a piece of Christmas cake,” Fernando said. She recalls them asking, “Where is my share? Did you keep me a piece?” Indrika Arnold, a wealth adviser in Lebanon, New Hampshire, has found another set of fans for her Christmas cake: her American co-workers. “I have some colleagues at work with whom I shared a piece, and they loved it. Now, they always ask, ‘When are you making your spice cake?’” she said. “I even mail it to some of my friends who no longer work with me.” She only made a half recipe when she started making Christmas cake five years ago. Now she’s doubled it. Arnold moved to the US 22 years ago but only started making the rich cake – as it’s known at other times of year – to share the tradition with her 12-year-old daughter. She has core memories of sitting around the kitchen table with her siblings and parents, cutting the preserved fruit into small pieces, and sneaking bits of raisins and cashews into her mouth when no one was looking. “A week or two before Thanksgiving, I get all the ingredients, and we actually get together as a family and cut it and we all take turns mixing the booze and the honey,” she said about how she continues this tradition with her daughter and husband in the US. She then leaves the fruits to stew in the alcohol mixture for at least two weeks, kick starting the holidays in their home. Like Arnold, Fernando also plans to gather around the table with her granddaughter to finely chop the fruit, which will then be soaked in a brandy mixture for one day. “By making it every Christmas, it has become a part of celebrating Christmas as Sri Lankans overseas,” Fernando said.","Fernando said people love the Christmas cake.

"Father Happy Jacob has a reason to be cheerful. When he started St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church in Liverpool in 2002, his congregation numbered about 60 families, and stayed at that level for almost two decades. Then, a few years ago, things began to change. “We have seen a massive increase in families coming to the church,” says Jacob, 48. At his last count, there were 110 families, with worshippers including NHS workers, international students and about 100 school-age children. This story is being repeated across Britain. From Liverpool to London, Preston to Bristol, church congregations are being bolstered by Indian Christians. Most are from southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where Christianity is strong. Many have recently moved to the UK. The boom is in sharp contrast to the national trend. According to the latest census, Christianity is in decline in England and Wales: the portion of the population describing itself as Christian has fallen from 59.3% in 2011 to 46.2% in 2021. But the number of Indian Christians has surged over the same period. While they remain a small portion of the total number – about 27.5 million –who say they are Christian, the Indian contingent rose from 135,988 in 2011 to 225,935 in 2021, the fastest rise of any ethnic group. “There are lots and lots of Christians coming from India,” says Rev Joshva Raja of the British and Foreign Bible Society. As well as boosting dedicated Indian churches, the new arrivals are contributing particularly to Catholic congregations, but Raja says: “I see some of the Anglican churches growing too.” Some of those arriving grew up as part of protestant denominations that were founded in India after it gained independence in 1947. NHS worker Pradeep George, 42, secretary at the Church of South India in East Ham, east London, says the number of families attending has doubled since before Covid to about 80. Services are quite similar to Church of England ones, with hymns, bible readings and a few twists, such as plum cake – popular in Kerala. Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church, also known as Indian Orthodox, which traces its origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in India in 52 AD.","Father Happy Jacob is happy. He started a church in Liverpool in 2002. It is called St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church.

At first, about 60 families came to the church. This was the same for almost 20 years. Then, things started to change a few years ago.

Jacob says that many more families are coming to the church now. He is 48 years old. He counted 110 families.

The people who come to the church are NHS workers, students from other countries, and children. About 100 children go to the church.

This is happening in other places in Britain too. Many Indian Christians are going to churches. They live in cities like Liverpool, London, Preston and Bristol.

Most of these Christians are from southern India. They come from places like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Christianity is popular in these places. Many of them have come to the UK recently.

This is different from what is happening in the whole country. In England and Wales, fewer people say they are Christian.

In 2011, about 59% of people said they were Christian. In 2021, only about 46% said they were Christian.

But the number of Indian Christians is growing. In 2011, about 135,000 Indian people said they were Christian. In 2021, about 225,000 Indian people said they were Christian. This is the biggest increase of any group.

Rev Joshva Raja works for a Bible society. He says that many Christians are coming from India.

These new people are helping Indian churches to grow. They are also going to Catholic churches. Raja says that some Anglican churches are growing too.

"The church’s weekly “energetic gathering” lasts about two hours and is usually held in Malayalam, Kerala’s official language. Afterwards, people stay to socialise for much of the day, sharing foods such as appam – fluffy rice pancakes – lamb biryani or croissants with tea. There is also a Sunday school with about 100 pupils. Over Christmas, carol singers from St Thomas’s run a door-to-door service in Liverpool, Chester and beyond, visiting all the families from the congregation. This weekend, dressed in Christmas jumpers, they were in the living room of Suriya Varghese, 37, and her husband Anup Cherian, 40, who recently started attending the church with their three children. The Keralan family had been living in Qatar before moving to the UK last year after both parents got jobs as electrical design engineers for the same company. Their involvement with the church extends far beyond Sunday services. Their children – Abner, 10, Anika, 7, and Arush, 4 – attend the Sunday school, where Suriya teaches. They had help from the church network with everything from finding housing and applying for driving licences to coping with UK weather and picking trustworthy handymen. “The church plays a very big role in our lives,” says Anup. “This is about being part of the community, especially for the kids.” For Ephrem Sam Mattappallil and his friends, the support afforded by the church community has also been a lifeline. Mattappallil, 25, who moved to London last year to study, runs a support group for students within the Indian Orthodox Church, many of whom are “struggling”. Last year, it helped about 120 people. “Our parents, relatives and friends are not here, and there is financial pressure as well,” Mattappallil says. “Through the church, we can find a lot of friends, and share our experiences. It helped me a lot.” Elsewhere, Indian Christians are finding community in mainstream churches. At the Catholic church of St Osmund in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Father Jonathan Creer has been “surprised” and “delighted” by the trend.","The church has a meeting every week. It is a happy and lively time. The meeting lasts about two hours. People speak Malayalam in the meeting. Malayalam is the language of Kerala. Kerala is a place in India.

"He said that in the past two years, mass attendance has been boosted by a “huge increase in the Indian community”, many of whom work at the local NHS hospital. The Indian families also include large numbers of children, teenagers and 20-somethings, who seem to have a more positive attitude to religion than some of their young British counterparts, he says. The increase has been particularly noticeable since the Covid lockdowns. “Some of our congregation – mostly older, white people – have still not come back, and some of them died, so it’s very noticeable now, looking out at mass, that we have many Asian and other faces,” Creer said. “It’s quite surprising in Salisbury, because you walk around the streets and it seems almost a mono-ethnic place, but actually, that’s not true.” He said that despite what some might think, the new arrivals had been really welcomed with open arms. “You might imagine that in a rather staid, middle-England place like Salisbury, people might wonder what was going on, but they have been delighted.” One way the congregation has embraced the Indian newcomers is by embracing a tradition observed in Kerala of passing around a “quite large” statue of the Virgin Mary, with a different worshipper taking it home each week. “People were very enthused about that,” Creer said. At other churches, Indian Christians have found themselves in the minority. Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn, from Chennai in Tamil Nadu, began attending the Anglican St John the Baptist church in Eltham, south-east London, after moving to the UK last year. “It’s mostly people from the local area at services,” he says. “It’s very rare to see another person from India.” At 25, the master’s student at Greenwich university is also much younger than most of the other worshippers. “Mostly it’s old age people here,” he says. “Whereas in India, people from different age categories come to the church.” Nevertheless, he has found the community “very welcoming”. The services in Eltham are also more fun, he says.","He said something about the church. In the last two years, more people are coming to church.

Many of these people are from India. They work at the hospital in the town. This is a big change for the church.

These Indian families have many children. They also have teenagers and young adults. These young people like religion. They seem to like it more than some young British people.

More people have come to the church since Covid. Some older people have not come back. Some of them died. Now, there are more Asian people in the church.

He said this is surprising in Salisbury. When you walk in the town, you see mostly white people. But the church is different.

He said the new people are welcome. People are happy to see them. Salisbury is a quiet town. But people are happy about the new people.

The church does something new. It is from a place in India called Kerala. They pass a statue of Mary around. It is a big statue. Each week, a different person takes it home. People like this very much.

He said Salisbury seems like a place with only one type of people. But that is not true.

He also said that people have welcomed the new people. Some people might think people would be surprised. But they are happy.

The church now does something new. They pass around a statue of Mary. It is a big statue. Each week, a different person takes the statue home. This is a tradition from Kerala in India. The priest said people liked this idea.

These Indian families have many children. They also have teenagers and young adults in their twenties. These young people seem to like religion more than some young British people.

He noticed this change after the Covid lockdowns. Some older people who used to come to church have not returned. Some of them have died. So, it is easy to see the change. Now, he sees many Asian faces at church.

He said this is surprising in Salisbury. When you walk around Salisbury, it seems like everyone is the same. But that is not true.

He also said that the new people are welcome. Some people might think people in Salisbury would not like the change. Salisbury is a quiet, traditional English place. But people are happy to have them.

"It was 4am on a Monday and most of Rio de Janeiro was asleep. But in the Morro do 77, a favela on the gritty westside of town, the party was just getting under way as hundreds of revellers packed the community’s main thoroughfare to strut their stuff before a three-metre (10ft) wall of sound. Speakers and subwoofers pumped ear-shattering favela funk music into the dawn air. Partygoers drank pint-sized cups of whiskey and frozen coconut water. And as heads bobbed, bodies twerked and window panes shook, the rave’s unexpected name flashed up on a screen above the dancefloor in a distinctly British blaze of red, blue and white. “The Baile de Londres,” it said. “The Party of London.” “Sometimes people go straight to work afterwards,” said one of the DJs, Hyago Domingos de Lima, before his deafening setlist rendered conversation impossible. The Sunday night blowout – during which partygoers, including one wearing an England football shirt, danced until 7am – is one of scores of favela funk parties now named after cities and countries around the world. The trend began about five years ago when musicians in one of Rio’s largest favelas, the Complexo do Lins, founded the Baile da Colombia (the Party of Colombia), a reference to the Brazilian neighbour’s long-running conflict and the deadly violence that also blights many gang-controlled areas in Rio. Sensing a foreign name could increase their brand profile and attract larger audiences, event organisers in favelas across the city reached for their maps. In Chapadão they named their event after Egypt, in Parque das Missões, Poland, and in Parque Arará, Portugal. One favela opted for China and used the Chinese national flag to advertise its rave. Another chose Japan, in homage to a local gangster nicknamed after the east-Asian country. In São Gonçalo, a satellite city to Rio’s east, promoters picked US cities, including New York, Brooklyn and Las Vegas.","It was Monday at 4 in the morning.

One of the DJs is Hyago Domingos de Lima. He said that some people go to work after the party. Then he started playing loud music. It was too loud to talk.

The party was on Sunday night. People danced until 7 am. One person wore an England football shirt. This party is one of many favela funk parties. These parties are named after cities and countries.

The idea started about five years ago. Musicians in Complexo do Lins, a big favela, started a party. They called it Baile da Colombia, or ""The Party of Colombia."" Colombia is a country next to Brazil. There is fighting and violence in Colombia. There is also violence in Rio's favelas, which are controlled by gangs.

The party organizers thought a foreign name would be good. They thought it would make their party more popular. They thought more people would come. So, they looked at maps and chose names.

In Chapadão, they named their party after Egypt. In Parque das Missões, they chose Poland. In Parque Arará, they chose Portugal. One favela chose China. They used the Chinese flag to advertise their party. Another favela chose Japan. This was because a gangster was nicknamed after Japan.

In São Gonçalo, a city near Rio, the party organizers chose US cities. They picked names like New York, Brooklyn, and Las Vegas.",0.903374195098877,0.5,80.68232662192398,1.0,0.8068232662192398,0.736732487106039,0.907173752784729,0.6666666666666666,79.77258799171844,0.8806853002070391,0.7619314699792961,0.7785906298102305,0.9085766077041626,0.8,77.52236551392895,0.7,0.6852236551392894,0.7979334209478174
"In Rocinha they celebrated Russia with the Baile de Moscow. In Jacarezinho they created the Baile de Paris. “I think there’s one named after every single country in the world,” said Kaio Gonçalves da Silva. The 26-year-old DJ plays at funk parties named after Acapulco and Saudi Arabia in Duque de Caxias, a city to Rio’s north. On his customised Sonic the Hedgehog motorbike, it takes him five minutes to get between the two gigs. “There the Party of Canada. There’s Libya. There’s Korea … There’s Croatia. There’s Sweden. I think there’s an Italy one too … There’s Ireland. There’s Scotland,” said Da Silva, AKA DJ Kaio VDM, the composer of a recent hit celebrating the Brazil and West Ham footballer Lucas Paquetá. Luiz Júnior, a DJ and producer from a westside favela called Vila Aliança, said that by the time the area’s musicians decided to adopt a country, “there were hardly any left”. So they plumped for Romania. “To be honest, I don’t know anything about Romania. Lots of people here don’t even know what the capital is … [But] people really liked the colour of the flag,” said Júnior, whose sound system, Ignorant, rents out massive custom-made speaker systems to parties including Argentina, Mexico and Iraq. Lima, whose DJ name is HG, came up with the Baile de Londres while shooting the breeze in Morro do 77’s main square with his friends Fatty Psycho, Haze, Xiclaudio and Big Dave. At first they considered Guatemala. Then someone floated England. But the Portuguese word for England (Inglaterra) had too many syllables and was a mouthful for MCs, he said. So they opted for the Baile de Londres and a new UK-themed Rio rave was born, with fliers featuring pictures of of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. Lima, who like most of the favela’s residents has never travelled abroad, admitted his knowledge of the UK capital was patchy.","In Rocinha, they had a party about Russia. It was called ""Baile de Moscow"". In Jacarezinho, they made a party about Paris. It was called ""Baile de Paris"".

"“When I think of London I think of … all those big buildings and that lake with the bridge over it,” he said of Tower Bridge. Marcelo Henrique dos Anjos da Silva, a dancer whose mesmerising dance steps at the Baile de Londres often go viral social media, associated London with little but the cold. “It’s the sort of place you need a jacket and a scarf,” Da Silva, whose nickname is ML, said as he sat in Morro do 77’s plaza in flip-flops and shorts. The creation of the Party of London has given the Brazilian favela a curiously British feel. The main street, Francisco Brício Avenue, has been informally renamed the Retão de Londres, which roughly translates as London Street. Last year a local football team was founded: the Seleção de Londres or Team London. In true English style, they made it to the final of the favela’s annual tournament but then lost. “They thrashed us: 4-0 or something,” said Pedro Gomes, one of the team’s defenders, as he showed off the favela’s synthetic pitch wearing his union-flag-branded kit. Gomes, who works in a hospital pharmacy when not protecting London’s goal, said the baile was an essential form of leisure for overburdened residents of his deprived neighbourhood. “It’s a way locals have off enjoying themselves when all they do is work, work, work. People need to have fun too,” the 25-year-old said as the event’s giant sound system was assembled behind him outside the evangelical church Vida Em Graça (Life in Grace). Rio’s funk scene has long been criminalised and vilified by authorities and critics who accuse it of glorifying drugs, guns and sex, although in recent years the movement has been widely recognised as a culture treasure and even celebrated in one of Brazil’s top art museums. The parties are also a crucial economic lifeline for Rio’s favelas, which are home to about 20% of the city’s population.","Marcelo said, ""I think of London. I think of big buildings and a lake.

Nevertheless, he called the parties a vital part of favela life. “Only people who live here grasp how important this is. Outsiders just don’t get it at all.” Moments later, the volume was cranked up and partiers began to arrive for a night of unbroken hedonism.

"Production was suspended at the last operating domestic factory of Japanese automaker Daihatsu on Tuesday, as the Toyota subsidiary grapples with a safety testing scandal affecting 64 models going back more than three decades. Issues with falsified crash tests first came to light in April, when the firm admitted it had manipulated data on four models manufactured in Thailand and Malaysia from 2022 until this year. The company has since acknowledged that similar issues have occurred across almost its entire production process, with an internal investigation discovering falsified data dating back to 1989. “We betrayed the trust of our customers,” said Daihatsu CEO Soichiro Okudaira at a Tokyo press conference last week. “All the blame is on the management.” On 20 December the company announced it would halt shipments of all models while further investigations and safety checks are carried out. Initial investigations have found that the shortening of vehicle development time was likely the main cause of corners being cut on safety checks. Head of the investigating panel Makoto Kaiami said, “There was tremendous pressure on employees as altering sales schedules due to test failures was widely seen as unacceptable.” Daihatsu identified doors that can become difficult to open from the outside after an accident as the major safety issue, though there have been no reports of related injuries. Included in the 64 models are vehicles manufactured by Daihatsu under contract for Toyota, Mazda and Subaru. Production is currently set to be suspended at its factories across Japan until at least the end of January, affecting 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 suppliers. Daihatsu produced about 870,000 vehicles in Japan last year, a supply chain worth approximately 2.2tn yen (US$15bn). Daihatsu, which was founded in Osaka in 1907 and taken over by Toyota in 1967, is currently negotiating with unions and suppliers over compensation while production remains suspended. Although Japanese cars are known for their safety and reliability, the industry has been hit by numerous scandals over the years. In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors finally confessed to covering up defects in its vehicles dating back to 1977, after partially admitting to related problems four years earlier. Similar issues then emerged at its subsidiary Fuso Truck and Bus in what became one of Japan’s worst corporate scandals.","Okay, here's the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level, focusing on simple language and structure:

**Daihatsu Stops Making Cars in Japan**

Daihatsu is a car company from Japan. It is owned by Toyota. Daihatsu has a problem with its safety tests.

On Tuesday, Daihatsu stopped making cars in its last factory in Japan.

The problem is about safety tests. These tests are for 64 different types of cars. The problems go back more than 30 years.

In April, Daihatsu said they changed some safety test results. This was for four types of cars made in Thailand and Malaysia. It happened from 2022 to this year.

Now, Daihatsu says that there are similar problems in almost all of their car making. They changed data since 1989.

The boss of Daihatsu, Soichiro Okudaira, said sorry. He said it was the fault of the managers.

On December 20, Daihatsu said they will stop sending out all their cars. They need to check the safety of the cars again.

The first checks show that they did not have enough time to make the cars. So, they did not check the safety carefully.

Makoto Kaiami is in charge of the checks. He said that workers felt too much pressure. If the cars failed the tests, they had to change the sales plans. This was not allowed.

Daihatsu found that some car doors are hard to open after an accident. This is a big safety problem. But, no one has been hurt because of this yet.

The 64 types of cars include cars made for Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru. Daihatsu made these cars for them.

The factories in Japan will stop making cars until the end of January. This affects 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 companies that give Daihatsu parts.

Last year, Daihatsu made about 870,000 cars in Japan. This is worth a lot of money.

Daihatsu started in 1907. Toyota took over Daihatsu in 1967. Daihatsu is talking to the workers and companies about money because the factories are closed.

Japanese cars are usually safe. But, there have been some problems in the past.

In 2004, another car company, Mitsubishi, said they hid problems with their cars. These problems started in 1977. Before that they said they had problems in 2000.

Then, Mitsubishi's truck company, Fuso, also had problems. This was a big problem for companies in Japan.","The Daihatsu car factory in Japan has stopped making cars. This factory was the last one working in Japan. Daihatsu is a company that belongs to Toyota.

There is a problem with the safety tests of Daihatsu cars. The company lied about the tests. This problem affects 64 different models of cars. Some of these cars were made more than 30 years ago.

The problem started in April. Daihatsu said they changed the test results for four car models. These cars were made in Thailand and Malaysia. The company did this from 2022 until this year.

Now, Daihatsu says that the problem is bigger. It happened in almost all of their car production. An investigation found that they changed data since 1989.

The boss of Daihatsu, Soichiro Okudaira, said sorry. He said that they broke the trust of their customers. He also said that the managers are to blame.

On December 20, the company said they would stop sending out all car models. They need to do more investigations and safety checks.

The first investigation found that the problem was because they wanted to make cars faster. They did not do all the safety checks carefully.

The person in charge of the investigation, Makoto Kaiami, said that workers felt a lot of pressure. They thought it was bad if they changed the sales plan because of failed tests.

Daihatsu said that the biggest safety problem is with the doors. After an accident, the doors might be hard to open from the outside. But, no one has been hurt because of this yet.

The 64 car models include cars made for Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru. Daihatsu makes these cars for them.

The factories in Japan will not make cars until the end of January. This affects 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 companies that supply parts.

Last year, Daihatsu made about 870,000 cars in Japan. This is worth about 2.2 trillion yen (15 billion US dollars).

Daihatsu started in Osaka in 1907. Toyota took over the company in 1967. Daihatsu is talking to the workers and suppliers about money because the factory is closed.

Japanese cars are known to be safe and good. But, there have been many problems in the car industry.

In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors said they hid problems with their cars. These problems started in 1977. They had already said there were some problems four years before.

Then, there were similar problems at Fuso Truck and Bus, which belongs to Mitsubishi. This was a big problem for companies in Japan.","Daihatsu stopped making cars at its last factory in Japan on Tuesday. Daihatsu is a car company that belongs to Toyota. They have a problem with safety tests. This problem affects 64 different car models. These models were made over 30 years.

The problem started in April. Daihatsu said they changed the data from crash tests. These tests were for four car models. The cars were made in Thailand and Malaysia between 2022 and this year.

Now, the company says the problem is bigger. It affects almost all the cars they make. An investigation found that they changed data as far back as 1989.

The CEO of Daihatsu, Soichiro Okudaira, spoke about this in Tokyo last week. He said they broke the trust of their customers. He said the managers are to blame.

On December 20, the company said they would stop sending out all car models. They will do more investigations and safety checks.

The first investigations show that they did not have enough time to develop the cars. This may be why they did not do all the safety checks carefully.

The head of the investigation, Makoto Kaiami, said that the employees felt a lot of pressure. He said that changing the sales dates because of failed tests was not acceptable.

Daihatsu said the main safety problem is with the doors. After an accident, the doors might be hard to open from the outside. But, there have been no reports of injuries because of this.

The 64 car models include cars made for Toyota, Mazda, and Subaru. Daihatsu makes these cars for them.

The factories in Japan will stop making cars until at least the end of January. This affects 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 companies that supply parts.

Last year, Daihatsu made about 870,000 cars in Japan. The value of these cars is about 2.2 trillion yen (15 billion US dollars).

Daihatsu started in Osaka in 1907. Toyota took over the company in 1967. Daihatsu is talking to the workers and suppliers about money to help them while the factories are closed.

"Before the arrival of Lundin Oil in the town of Leer, now part of South Sudan, life there was peaceful, says George Tai Kuony. His childhood was that of a “typical village boy”, driving cattle, helping his family and going to school. But in June 1998, when he was 15, armed forces entered the town and changed his life for ever. He fled, became separated from his family and hid for seven days before he was able to return. “When we got there, Leer wasn’t the town I had left seven days ago,” says the 40-year-old lawyer and human rights defender. “Everything was burned down, everything was destroyed. I could see the bodies of dead people lying in the street.” As a result of the conflict, he lost his father, and later his mother and one sibling. At the time, he says, the community had no idea why people were fighting. They had never heard of the Swedish oil company. Now, a quarter of a century later, Kuony hopes that he and the other victims will get justice as two former executives of the company go on trial in Stockholm accused of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sudan between 1999 and 2003. In Sweden’s largest-ever trial, Ian Lundin, a Swede, and Alex Schneiter, who is Swiss, stand accused of asking Sudan’s government to make its army and allied militia responsible for security at one of Lundin Oil’s exploration fields. This led to aerial bombings, civilian killings and the burning of entire villages, according to the prosecution. Both men deny the charges. The trial, which follows a decade-long investigation, hundreds of interviews and an 80,000-page report by the prosecution, started in September. But its most significant moments are expected in 2024, when 61 witnesses – including victims, Lundin employees, former UN staff and high-profile politicians – are due to appear. They include Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, who sat on the company’s board for five years until becoming the country’s foreign minister. “My life has never been the same,” says Kuony, speaking to the Observer from South Sudan’s capital, Juba, where he now lives.","George Tai Kuony says that life in Leer was good before Lundin Oil came. Leer is now in South Sudan. George was a normal village boy. He took care of cows. He helped his family. He went to school.

In June 1998, soldiers came to Leer. George was 15 years old. This changed his life. He ran away from the soldiers. He lost his family. He hid for seven days. Then he went back to Leer.

George is now 40 years old. He is a lawyer and helps people. He says Leer was not the same when he came back. The town was burned. Everything was broken. He saw dead people in the street.

George lost his father in the war. Later, he lost his mother and one brother. He did not know why people were fighting. He had never heard of Lundin Oil. Lundin Oil is a company from Sweden.

Now, it has been 25 years. George hopes he and others will get justice. Two people who worked for Lundin Oil will go to trial. The trial is in Stockholm, Sweden. They are accused of helping war crimes in Sudan. This happened between 1999 and 2003.

Ian Lundin is from Sweden. Alex Schneiter is from Switzerland. They are accused of asking the Sudan government for help. They wanted the army to protect Lundin Oil's land. The army hurt people. They bombed from the sky. They killed people. They burned villages. The two men say they did not do these things.

The trial started in September. It took ten years to prepare for the trial. The police talked to many people. They wrote a report with 80,000 pages. The most important part of the trial will be in 2024.

61 people will speak at the trial. Some are victims. Some worked for Lundin Oil. Some worked for the United Nations. Some are important politicians. Carl Bildt will speak. He was the Prime Minister of Sweden. He worked for Lundin Oil for five years. Then he became the Foreign Minister.

George now lives in Juba. Juba is the capital of South Sudan. He says his life is not the same after the war. He spoke to the Observer newspaper.","George Tai Kuony says that life in his town was good before Lundin Oil came. His town was called Leer. It is now in South Sudan.

At that time, the people did not know why they were fighting. They did not know about the oil company. The oil company was from Sweden.

Now, it has been 25 years. George hopes he and other people who were hurt will get justice. Two men who worked for the oil company are going to court in Stockholm. They are accused of helping with war crimes in Sudan. This happened between 1999 and 2003.

The trial is very big in Sweden. One man is Ian Lundin. He is from Sweden. The other man is Alex Schneiter. He is from Switzerland.

They are accused of asking the government of Sudan to use its army to protect the oil company's land. The army and other soldiers then bombed the area. People were killed. Villages were burned.

The two men say they did not do these things.

The trial started in September after a long time of checking. The police talked to many people. They wrote a long report. The report is 80,000 pages long.

Important things will happen in 2024. Sixty-one people will speak in court. These people include victims, people who worked for Lundin, people who worked for the United Nations, and important politicians.

One of them is Carl Bildt. He used to be the Prime Minister of Sweden. He was on the oil company's board for five years. Then he became the Foreign Minister.

"“Oil came to our area: it should have been a blessing. It should have been for the benefit of the community.” Instead, there was “a massacre. They wanted us dead. They wanted us to go away.” Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006, when the group unsuccessfully sought redress at a court in Sudan. He hopes the trial, whatever its outcome, will set a new legal precedent for global corporations working in foreign jurisdictions, sending a “very strong message” that they cannot act with impunity. “That one day they will be prosecuted in the same way.” But the victims have already been dealt a significant blow. Ebony Wade, a legal adviser at Stockholm-based human rights organisation Civil Rights Defenders, said Stockholm district court’s decision in November to separate the plaintiffs’ damage claims from the criminal trial would make it “significantly harder” – if not impossible – to have their cases heard, and would considerably delay the justice process. While the plaintiffs’ testimonies were still expected to be included in the criminal trial, she said, this could push the civil claims back until the criminal trial was over, which would not be until February 2026. However, May 2024 will be a historic moment: for the first time the court will hear the experiences of plaintiffs and victims from South Sudan. “It’s incredibly rare for corporate executives to be held accountable for grave human rights violation,” says Wade. “For the first time, the leadership of a multinational company is being put on trial in a European country on allegations that they were complicit in war crimes in the conduct of their business activities.” She adds: “There are very few opportunities for victims of grave international crimes to seek redress, so in that sense this is an incredibly important trial.” Rev James Ninrew Dong, of the Presbyterian Church in South Sudan, fled Leer after religious buildings were targeted. The priest, who is a witness and a plaintiff in the case, said he felt compelled to testify: “They attacked us. They displaced us. What made me sorry is that people came to the church seeking safety and were not able to get it. They were also displaced.” For him, the case demonstrates the different standards applied by European companies operating in Africa.","Oil came to our area. It should have helped us. It should have been good for everyone in our community.

But bad things happened. There was a big killing. They wanted to kill us. They wanted us to leave.

Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006. He went to a court in Sudan, but it did not work.

Now, he hopes for a new trial. He wants this trial to be a lesson for big companies. These companies work in other countries. He wants them to know they cannot do bad things without punishment. They will be judged like everyone else.

But it will be hard for the people who were hurt. Ebony Wade works for a human rights group. She said the court in Sweden made a bad decision. The court will hear the criminal part of the case first. It will hear the claims for money later. This makes it harder for the victims to be heard. It will take more time to get justice.

The victims will still talk about what happened in the criminal trial. But the money claims might not be heard until 2026.

May 2024 will be important. The court will listen to the people from South Sudan. It is rare for big company leaders to be judged for hurting people.

Wade said it is important because it is very rare for leaders of big companies to be punished for bad things they do. This trial is in a European country. The leaders are accused of helping war crimes. This happened while they were doing business.

She also said it is hard for victims of big crimes to get justice. This trial is very important.

Rev James Ninrew Dong is a priest. He is from South Sudan. He ran away from his town after churches were attacked. He is a witness in the case. He is also someone who was hurt. He wants to tell his story.

He said they attacked and moved people. People went to the church to be safe, but they were not safe. They had to leave.

He thinks European companies treat people in Africa unfairly.","Oil came to our town. It should have been a good thing. It should have helped everyone in our community.

But it was not good. It was a terrible thing. There was a big killing. They wanted to kill us. They wanted us to leave.

Kuony wants justice. He has been trying to get justice since 2006. He asked a court in Sudan, but it did not work.

Now, he hopes for a new trial. He hopes it will teach big companies a lesson. These companies work in other countries. He wants them to know they must follow the rules. They cannot do bad things without punishment. He wants them to be punished like everyone else.

But it is hard for the people who were hurt. Ebony Wade works for a human rights group. She said the court in Stockholm made a bad decision. The court will hear the criminal part of the case first.

The victims will still tell their stories in the criminal trial. But the case about money will be delayed. It might not start until 2026.

However, May 2024 will be important. The court will listen to the people from South Sudan. This is the first time this will happen.

Ebony Wade said it is rare for company leaders to be punished for hurting people. This is the first time a big company is on trial in Europe. The company is accused of helping with war crimes. These crimes happened while they were doing business.

She said it is very hard for victims of big crimes to get justice. This trial is very important because it gives them a chance.

Rev James Ninrew Dong is a priest. He ran away from his town after the churches were attacked. He is a witness in the case. He also wants justice. He felt he had to tell his story.

He said they attacked us and made us leave our homes. People went to the church for safety, but they were not safe. They had to leave too.

He thinks European companies act differently in Africa. He believes they have different rules for Africa.","Oil was found in our area. It should have been a good thing for us. It should have helped our community. But instead, there was a terrible event. People were killed. They wanted us to die. They wanted us to leave our homes.

Kuony has been trying to get fairness since 2006. In that year, he tried to get help from a court in Sudan, but he was not successful. Now, he hopes this new trial will help. He hopes it will make a new rule for big companies that work in other countries. He wants to send a message to them. He wants them to know they cannot do bad things without being punished. He wants them to know they will be judged for their actions.

But the people who were hurt have already had a setback. Ebony Wade works for a human rights group. She said that the court in Stockholm made a decision. The court decided to separate the money claims from the criminal trial. This will make it much harder for the people to have their cases heard. It will also take a long time to get justice.

However, May 2024 will be an important time. The court will listen to the stories of people from South Sudan for the first time. Wade said it is very rare for leaders of companies to be held responsible for human rights problems. This is the first time that leaders of a big company are being tried in a European country.

"Accusations are growing that the former Sri Lankan government, led by strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blocked an investigation into the country’s worst terrorist attack amid claims that they had helped orchestrate the blasts in order to return to power. In the attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019, six suicide bombers targeted churches and luxury hotels across the country, killing 269 people, including eight British tourists. But almost five years on, an investigation has failed to provide any answers for how the attacks took place and the security failures that led up to them. So far, there have been no criminal convictions. Instead, people previously involved in the investigation, and the leader of Sri Lanka’s Catholic church, have alleged that inquiries were repeatedly sabotaged and obstructed by the Rajapaksa government. In a recent documentary for Channel 4’s Dispatches, a whistleblower alleged that the attacks were part of a plan to create instability in Sri Lanka and ensure that Rajapaksa, a member of Sri Lanka’s most powerful political family, would win the presidential elections in 2019. The source said he had helped an intelligence officer with close ties to the Rajapaksa family meet members of the local Islamist militant group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ), that carried out the attack. He said it had been part of a plan that had been hatched over a couple of years to create an “unsafe” security situation that would help bring Rajapaksa to power. The Rajapaksa family had ruled Sri Lanka for almost a decade from 2005. They were credited with ending its bloody, 26-year-long civil war but became notorious for their authoritarian methods, including the use of “death squads” to target critics and journalists. Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted in 2015 after a backlash against alleged corruption, but the family had planned a return to power in the 2019 election, this time with younger brother Gotabaya as the presidential candidate. He won the election but was toppled dramatically from power in July last year, after the country experienced a catastrophic economic crisis, and replaced by Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is seen as close to the Rajapaksa family.","Some people are saying the old government in Sri Lanka did something bad. The old government was led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He was a very powerful man.

People say his government stopped the investigation into a big attack. This attack was the worst one in Sri Lanka. Some people think the government helped plan the attack. They wanted to get back in power.

The attack happened on Easter Sunday in 2019. Six people blew themselves up. They attacked churches and hotels. Many people died, including tourists. 269 people died in total, including eight British tourists.

It has been almost five years since the attack. But the investigation has not found any answers. We do not know how the attack happened. We also do not know why the security was so bad. No one has been found guilty of a crime.

Some people who worked on the investigation say the government stopped them. The leader of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka also says this. They say the Rajapaksa government made it hard to find out the truth.

A man spoke about this on TV. He said the attack was part of a plan. The plan was to make Sri Lanka unsafe. This would help Rajapaksa win the election in 2019.

The man said he helped a person meet some attackers. This person worked for the Rajapaksa family. The attackers were from a group called NTJ. NTJ did the attack.

The man said the plan was made over a few years. The plan was to make Sri Lanka unsafe. This would help Rajapaksa become the leader.

The Rajapaksa family was in charge of Sri Lanka for ten years. They stopped a long war. But they also did bad things. They were very strict. They used groups to hurt people who did not agree with them.

Mahinda Rajapaksa was the leader before. But he lost the election in 2015. People thought he was not honest. The family wanted to be in charge again in 2019.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the candidate for president. He won the election. But he had to leave in 2022. Sri Lanka had big money problems. Ranil Wickremesinghe is now the leader.

The investigation was about a big terrorist attack. Some people think the government helped plan this attack. They say the government wanted to get back in power.

The attack happened on Easter Sunday in 2019. Six people killed themselves by using bombs. They attacked churches and nice hotels. 269 people died, including eight people from Britain.

Now, it is almost five years later. The investigation has not found out how the attack happened. It also has not found out why the security was so bad. No one has been found guilty in court.

Some people who worked on the investigation say the Rajapaksa government made it difficult. The leader of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka also says this. They say the government stopped the investigation many times.

A person who knows about the attack spoke about it in a TV show. This person said the attack was part of a plan. The plan was to make Sri Lanka unsafe. This would help Rajapaksa win the election in 2019.

The person said he helped an intelligence officer. This officer was close to the Rajapaksa family. He helped the officer meet some people. These people were from a group called National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ). This group did the attack.

The person said the plan took a few years to make. The plan was to make Sri Lanka feel ""unsafe."" This would help Rajapaksa become president.

"Ravi Seneviratne, the former director general of police who initially led the Easter attacks investigation, told the Observer that after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected president, the government had “prevented the investigation”. He said his team had already “established links” between state and military intelligence officers and the NTJ suicide bombers. He said that the investigations had also led him to believe there was someone higher up helping to coordinate the attack who had yet to be apprehended. However, when Rajapaksa took office, Seneviratne’s entire team at CID was taken off the case. More than 20 of his officers were transferred without his approval and travel bans were imposed on all 700 CID officers. “The motive was to make them too scared to send a message. Many were too scared to work and some people even applied for transfers out of CID,” he said. Since then, Seneviratne claims there have been several attempts to “keep me quiet”. The targeting of those involved in the investigation took a murkier turn this month after the attorney general told the courts that there had been a conspiracy to murder Shani Abeysekara, the former head of Sri Lanka’s CID, who was overseeing the investigation before he was suddenly removed when the Rajapaska government came to power. A court petition filed by Abeysekara, which was taken up this month, said a plan to kill him in a staged vehicle accident had been uncovered. The petition identifie dhis involvement in the bombing investigation as one of the reasons for the assassination attempt. Upul Jayasuriya, the lawyer representing Abeysekara, said that his client’s involvement in the Easter bombing investigation was “one of the biggest problems”. Still fearful for his life, Abeysekara declined to comment directly on the case. Last year, Abeysekara went public with allegations that prior to the attacks – when the CID was already investigating NTJ militants – state and military intelligence officers had sabotaged the investigation and “fabricated” evidence to divert investigators away from the group, including ringleader Zahran Hashim, who later carried out one of the suicide bombings.","Ravi Seneviratne used to be the police chief. He was in charge of the Easter attacks investigation at the start. He told a newspaper that the government stopped his investigation. This happened after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president.

Ravi said his team found connections. These connections were between government and army people and the bombers. The bombers belonged to a group called NTJ.

Ravi also thought someone important helped the bombers. This person was not caught. But when Rajapaksa became president, Ravi's team was stopped. They could not work on the case anymore.

More than 20 police officers were moved to other jobs. Ravi did not agree with this. Also, 700 police officers were not allowed to travel. Ravi said the government wanted to scare them. They did not want them to talk about the case. Many police officers were afraid to work. Some asked to leave the CID, the police department.

Ravi said people tried to ""keep him quiet"". This means they tried to stop him from talking.

The case became more complicated. The government lawyer told the court something. He said someone planned to kill Shani Abeysekara. Shani used to be the head of the CID. He was in charge of the investigation before. But he was removed from his job when Rajapaksa became president.

Shani asked the court for help. He said someone planned to kill him in a car accident. He said this happened because he was investigating the Easter bombings.

Upul Jayasuriya is Shani's lawyer. He said the Easter bombing investigation was ""one of the biggest problems"" for Shani.

Shani is still afraid for his life. He did not want to talk about the case.

Last year, Shani said something important. He said that before the attacks, the CID was already investigating the NTJ group. He said government and army people stopped the investigation.

"He has also alleged that his attempts to raise the issue of NTJ militants with the national security council had been obstructed. After the Easter bombings, he said, his investigators had established links and vidence of communication between intelligence officials and members of the NTJ group that carried out the attacks. Another former CID officer who was part of an investigation into NTJ militants months before the bombings, and who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, confirmed the accounts. “There were several attempts that were made by the military intelligence and state intelligence to sabotage the criminal investigation department’s work,” he said. While more than 200 people have been charged in the investigation, so far no one has been convicted, and there have been no answers on how several specific high-level warnings about the imminent attacks, particularly from Indian intelligence, were ignored. In January, former president Maithripala Sirisena, who was in power at the time of the attacks, was ordered by the supreme court to pay millions in compensation to the victims. Following the Dispatches revelations, the Sri Lankan government said it had set up a special parliamentary committee to investigate allegations, but sources said that no one had been called to testify before it. A recent statement by the ministry of defence said the government “vehemently denounces the accusation of orchestrating the attack and assisting the bombers against a dedicated senior military officer who has served the nation for 36 years”. The ministry added that “successive Sri Lankan governments have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth”. Gotabaya Rajapaksa could not be reached for comment. Among the harshest critics of the ongoing failures is Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, who alleges there was a cover-up from the highest levels of government. “When Gotabaya Rajapaksa came to power, he appointed a stooge to take over the case who made a blunder of all investigations,” he said. “We know that there are several occasions when evidence was deliberately covered up.","He said he tried to talk about the NTJ group with the security council. But he could not.

The NTJ group did the Easter bombings. After the bombings, his people found something. They found that some people in intelligence talked to the NTJ group.

Another police officer also knows about this. He worked on the NTJ case before the bombings. He wants to stay secret because he is afraid. He said that some intelligence people tried to stop the police from working.

More than 200 people have been charged. But nobody has been found guilty yet. People want to know why warnings were not taken seriously. India warned about the attacks. But nobody listened.

The former president was Maithripala Sirisena. He was the president when the attacks happened. The court told him to pay money to the victims.

Someone told the news about this. The government said they will look into it. They made a group to check the claims. But nobody has been asked questions yet.

After the news reports, the government said they will check the claims. They made a group in the parliament to look into it. But some people say no one has been asked to talk to the group.

"The US government has announced the release of what it said was its last available package of weapons available for Ukraine, with Congress needing to decide on future support. According to the state department, it is worth up to $250m and includes air defence munitions and components, Himars ammunition, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, anti-armour munitions, and over 15m rounds of ammunition. The war in 2024 “must be different from 2023”, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces has said. “Otherwise we will face what I wrote about in the article [the Economist]”, said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi. “Unfortunately, I must state that the enemy is not far behind us. In recent days, we have had a powerful confrontation applying modern technologies. But we do not spare efforts. My main mistake was that I thought that the amount of losses we inflicted on the enemy would stop anyone. But not the Russian Federation.” Zaluzhnyi, giving a press conference, said Ukrainian troops remained on a defensive line in the northern part of Maryinka. “But I can say that this settlement no longer exists. The [Russian] method is the same as it was in Bakhmut. Street by street, block by block are destroyed. The fact that we have now moved to the outskirts of Maryinka, and in some places equipped positions beyond Maryinka, seems to me to be nothing that can cause a public outcry.” “As for the conduct of hostilities around Avdiivka,” he continued, “there is no need to dwell on it and make a show of it. The conduct of hostilities is subject to the laws of war, and they are not subject to what politicians or journalists want. The enemy now has the opportunity to concentrate forces; they can do to the city in two or three months what they have done to Bakhmut.” Two people were killed in Russian drone attacks on Odesa, according to figures from the Odesa oblast governor, Oleh Kiper. A 17-year-old was among the wounded and remained in hospital.

Zaluzhnyi said Ukrainian soldiers are defending near Maryinka. He said the town is gone. The enemy is destroying it like they did in Bakhmut. They are destroying it street by street. Ukrainian soldiers are now near Maryinka, but this is not a surprise.

He also talked about the fighting near Avdiivka. He said the fighting follows the rules of war. It does not matter what politicians or journalists want. The enemy can now use many soldiers there. They can destroy the city in a few months like they destroyed Bakhmut.

They are destroying it street by street. He said they have moved to the edge of Maryinka. He does not think this is a big problem.

He also talked about the fighting near Avdiivka. He said there is no need to talk about it too much. He said the fighting follows the rules of war. It does not matter what politicians or journalists want. Russia can now send more soldiers to Avdiivka. They could destroy the city in a few months, like they did to Bakhmut.

"Shelling by Russian forces on Tuesday had “badly damaged” the infrastructure of the city, he said, adding that it was “difficult” to say when repairs would be completed. A railway station was attacked as a train was set to evacuate residents, killing one police officer and injuring four people. A Russian politician calling for peace in Ukraine has been denied the chance to run for president. Russia’s central election commission refused to accept the former regional legislator Yekaterina Duntsova’s initial nomination by a group of supporters, citing errors in the paperwork, including spelling. After losing Wednesday’s appeal against the commission’s decision, Duntsova said she would start working on the creation of her own political party that would stand for “peace, freedom and democracy”. Poland is getting closer to ending the truck driver blockades of several border crossings with Ukraine, says the country’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. Polish drivers have been blocking several crossings with Ukraine since 6 November, demanding the EU reinstate a system whereby Ukrainian companies need permits and the same for European truckers to enter Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks in Moscow with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and said progress had been made on plans for Russia and India to jointly produce military equipment. Jaishankar added that he expected Vladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to meet next year. Russia says its newest howitzers will be deployed “soon” against Ukrainian forces. The head of the state-owned defence conglomerate Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, told the RIA news agency that testing of the new self-propelled artillery units, named Coalition-SV, had been completed and mass production had started, with the pilot batch to be delivered by the end of this year.

"Just after 3 o’clock, the children start running towards the Arab-Jewish community centre. The activities are about to begin – though this is not the reason for their haste. Moments before, sirens wailed across Tel Aviv and Jaffa, warning of another rocket attack. Some cry out in fear as the metal shutters of the centre rattle down. Ten minutes later, after two loud booms signal that the rockets launched from Gaza have been destroyed in the air, the children file out of the malodorous basement of the centre and head for gym class, music lessons and a crafts session organised by an NGO that is trying to improve relations between Israel’s Jewish and Arab populations. Even the most enthusiastic of Standing Together’s activists and leaders admit that, after 11 weeks of war, the moment is inauspicious for such initiatives. “These are extreme times. People are still processing the Hamas attack and the war in Gaza. People are in survival mode and thinking in black and white,” said Nadav Shofet, Standing Together’s lead community organiser in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. One slender reason for hope is sharp rise in volunteers since the war began, members of the NGO say. Since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel in October, which killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians, thousands have joined the organisation. During the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed about 18,000 people, mostly women and children, and destroyed swaths of the territory, more have come forward to work with the group. “People are looking for a solution … It might seem crazy now but it’s clear the only way out is peace,” said Shofet. Outside the community centre, overlooking a sweep of beach and the Mediterranean, the municipal authorities have hung a banner bearing the slogan: “Together, all Jaffa’s residents will get through this”. Inside, a menorah for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah stands alongside a Christmas tree. The combination of rain and rockets means about only six children have turned up for the crafts session organised by Standing Together. Orit Tammuz, a 65-year-old Jewish former dancer, had brought her granddaughter Amani. “For me, all this is a natural thing.","At three o'clock, the children start to run. They run to the Arab-Jewish community center. The activities are going to start. But this is not why they are running.

Before, loud alarms sounded in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. The alarms warned about a rocket attack. Some children are scared. They cry. The metal doors of the center close quickly with a loud noise.

Ten minutes later, there were two loud sounds. The rockets from Gaza were destroyed in the air. The children leave the smelly basement of the center. They go to gym class, music, and crafts.

A group called Standing Together is helping. They want Jewish and Arab people in Israel to be friends. But it is a hard time for this.

Nadav Shofet works for Standing Together. He said it is a difficult time. People are thinking about the Hamas attack and the war. People are worried about staying alive. They see things as only good or bad.

But there is some hope. More people want to help since the war started. Many people have joined the group.

In October, Hamas attacked Israel. Many people died. After this, more people wanted to help Standing Together. The Israeli army is fighting in Gaza. Many people have died there too. Because of this, even more people want to help.

Nadav Shofet said people want a solution. He said that peace is the only way.

Outside the center, there is a sign. It says, ""Together, all Jaffa’s residents will get through this."" The center looks over the beach and the sea.

Inside the center, there is a Hanukkah candle holder. Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. There is also a Christmas tree.

It is raining and there are rockets. So, only six children came to the crafts time. Standing Together organized it.

Orit Tammuz is 65 years old. She used to be a dancer. She brought her granddaughter Amani. Orit said that helping is natural for her.","Around 3 o'clock, children start running to a special center.

He said people are still upset about the attack by Hamas and the war in Gaza. He said people are worried about staying alive and only see things as good or bad.

But there is some hope. More people want to help since the war started. Many people have joined Standing Together since October. In October, Hamas attacked Israel. 1,200 people died, mostly people who were not soldiers.

"Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, in our family we don’t make a difference. There is no victory if this is not a country for all of us,” she said. Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise 21% of the population, often living in cities where they are a majority. Jaffa, with its mixed community, has attracted many young Jewish families in recent years, many with progressive views who feel out of step with the rightwards trend of Israeli society in general. This has led to sharp increases in property prices, which have forced out often poorer Arab residents. Tammuz admitted that neither Jaffa nor the crafts class was very representative of Israel, particularly at the moment. “Here, this is like being in a small bubble but we hope it will become bigger, or I don’t see any solution,” she said. Other activities run by Standing Together include food distributions to families experiencing economic hardship, renovating public bomb shelters and a series of well-attended rallies. The organisation, founded in 2016, has also set up an unarmed joint Arab-Jewish “civil guard” to protect all communities and alert police in the event of violence. The goal of many efforts was simply to bring members of different communities together, said Amir Badran, an organiser in Jaffa for Standing Together and a local politician and lawyer. This includes the popular children’s craft sessions, held every week for two months. “Although people are in big distress, they would still prefer to get together … We don’t want the kids to be afraid of each other and hate each other. Here, they get to know each other and the parents get to meet,” Badran said. Quite how difficult finding the common ground that Standing Together seeks is clear to almost everyone in Israel. The government is the most rightwing in the country’s history, including politicians accused of “inflammatory rhetoric” before the current conflict. Though there have been no major outbreaks of violence, relations between the Jewish majority and citizens who are Arab, many of whom now identify as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are tense. “At times of war people become more radical, and [the right] is using this war to incite against Palestinian citizens,” said Rula Daood, Standing Together’s co-director.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

In our family, we don't care if you are Arab, Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. We are all the same. This country must be good for everyone. If not, no one wins.

Many people in Israel are Palestinian. They are citizens of Israel. They are 21% of the people. They often live in cities where most people are also Palestinian.

Jaffa is a city with Arabs and Jewish people. Many young Jewish families have moved there. They don't like the way Israel is going. Israel is becoming more right-wing.

The price of houses in Jaffa is going up. This makes it hard for Arab people to live there. They are often poor and must leave.

Tammuz said that Jaffa is not like all of Israel. The crafts class is also not like all of Israel. ""We are like a small bubble here,"" she said. ""We hope it will grow bigger. If not, I don't see a solution.""

Standing Together is an organization. They help people in different ways. They give food to families who don't have much money. They fix bomb shelters for everyone to use. They also have many meetings with lots of people.

Standing Together started in 2016. They have a group of Arab and Jewish people. They are like a ""civil guard."" They don't have weapons. They protect everyone in the community. If there is violence, they call the police.

Amir Badran works for Standing Together in Jaffa. He is also a local leader and a lawyer. He said that Standing Together wants to bring people together. He organizes things like the children's crafts class. It is every week for two months.

""People are having a hard time,"" Badran said. ""But they still want to be together. We don't want kids to be afraid of each other. We don't want them to hate each other. Here, they meet each other. The parents also meet.""

It is hard to find common ground in Israel. Almost everyone knows this. The government is the most right-wing it has ever been. Some politicians have said bad things before the war.

There has not been a lot of violence. But Jewish people and Arab citizens are not getting along very well. Many Arab citizens now think of themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel. They are tense.

Rula Daood is a leader at Standing Together. She said, ""When there is a war, people become more extreme. The right-wing is using the war to make people angry at Palestinian citizens.""","In our family, we treat everyone the same. Arabs, Muslims, Christians, and Jews are all equal. We want a country where everyone belongs. We cannot win if this is not true for everyone.

Palestinian people live in Israel. They are 21% of the people there. Often, they live in cities where most people are also Palestinian.

Jaffa is a city where different people live together. Many young Jewish families have moved there. They have new ideas. They don't like how Israel is changing to the right. Because of this, houses in Jaffa cost more money. This makes it hard for Arab people who don't have much money to live there. They have to move away.

Tammuz said that Jaffa and the crafts class are not like most of Israel. She said, ""Here, it is like we are in a small bubble. We hope it will grow bigger. If not, I don't see a good future.""

Standing Together is an organization. They help families who don't have enough money by giving them food. They fix bomb shelters for everyone to use. They also have many big meetings.

Standing Together started in 2016. They created a group of Arab and Jewish people who work together. They do not have weapons. They help protect everyone and tell the police if there is violence.

Amir Badran works for Standing Together in Jaffa. He is also a politician and a lawyer. He said that they want to bring people from different groups together. They have crafts classes for children every week for two months.

Badran said, ""People are having a hard time, but they still want to meet. We don't want the children to be scared of each other and hate each other. Here, they can meet each other. The parents can also meet.""

It is hard to find common ground in Israel. Standing Together is trying to do this.

The government of Israel is now the most right-wing it has ever been. Some politicians in the government have said things that make people angry.

There has not been a lot of violence. But Jewish people and Arab citizens in Israel do not get along well. Many Arab citizens now say they are Palestinian citizens of Israel. The situation is tense.

Rula Daood is the co-director of Standing Together. She said, ""When there is war, people become more extreme. The right-wing is using this war to turn people against Palestinian citizens.""","""In our family, we don't care if you are Arab, Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. This country must be good for everyone,"" she said.

Palestinians who are citizens of Israel are 21% of the people in the country. They often live in cities where most people are also Palestinian.

Jaffa is a city where Arabs and Jewish people live together. Many young Jewish families have moved to Jaffa. They have new ideas and don't agree with the more conservative views in Israel.

Because of this, houses in Jaffa have become very expensive. Many Arab people who don't have much money have been forced to leave.

Tammuz said that Jaffa and the crafts class are not like most of Israel right now. ""This is like a small, safe space. We hope it will grow, or I don't see a good future,"" she said.

The group ""Standing Together"" does other things too. They give food to families who are poor. They fix up bomb shelters. They also hold many public meetings.

This group started in 2016. They have created a group of Arab and Jewish people who work together. They are like a security team that does not use weapons. They protect everyone and tell the police if there is violence.

Amir Badran works for ""Standing Together"" in Jaffa. He is also a local politician and a lawyer. He said that many of their projects try to bring different groups of people together.

One example is the children's crafts sessions. They happen every week for two months. ""People are having a hard time, but they still want to be together. We don't want the children to be scared of each other or hate each other. Here, they meet each other, and their parents meet too,"" Badran said.

It is very hard to find common ground in Israel. Almost everyone knows this.

The government is now the most conservative it has ever been. Some politicians have been accused of saying things that make people angry before the current problems.

There has not been a lot of violence. But the relationship between Jewish people and Arab citizens is not good. Many Arab citizens now think of themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel.

""When there is war, people become more extreme. Some people are using this war to cause trouble for Palestinian citizens,"" said Rula Daood.

"“Whether you are a regular, public or political figure, if you say anything that isn’t a call for revenge or wiping out Gaza, you are seen as part of the enemy now. Writing ‘May God have mercy on Gaza, children in Gaza’ – that’s enough to get you targeted.” Since the attacks on 7 October, a series of prominent Arab Israelis have been arrested. In October, the singer Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested briefly after posting “there is no victor but Allah” alongside a Palestinian flag on Facebook. Some of the community’s most prominent political leaders were held after planning an anti-war protest. Standing Together has set up a hotline “to give people a place, Palestinian or Jews, to turn to” if they are being harassed. A recent poll found nearly 60% of Arab Israelis were afraid of being harassed and 10% had personal experience of harassment. Daood said: “This is a real setback in Israeli society, especially Jewish society. The pain people are living in and the terror they have had since 7 October … It has basically blinded people and people are beginning to lose their own humanity. “We have had so many bad moments, maybe this is the most traumatic, but we have been able to rise up after each and every incident before. We are trying to show there is still another path and another way.” Among the people watching the children making finger puppets and posters in Jaffa was Vera Deek, an Arab Christian former teacher. “We believe in coexistence … that’s why I brought my daughter here. But [the problem] is not with the children,” Deek said. “It’s very difficult to be here, trying to live a normal life, when so many people have died or are still dying.” Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and relatives in Gaza but also in the attacks on 7 October. Some of the first deaths reported were four people who died when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a Bedouin village in the Negev desert. Arab Israelis responding to the ground offensive, including paramedics, were also killed by Hamas. The Negev’s Bedouin tribes were some of the first to organise volunteer teams to search for missing Israelis.","It is hard for people to speak freely now. If you don't say you want revenge, people think you are the enemy. Even saying ""God help the children in Gaza"" can be dangerous.

After October 7, many Arab citizens of Israel were arrested. One singer, Dalal Abu Amneh, put a Palestinian flag on Facebook. She also wrote, ""Only God is the winner."" She was arrested for a short time.

Some Arab political leaders planned a protest against the war. They were also arrested.

A group called Standing Together has a phone line. People who are being bothered can call them. This helps both Jewish and Palestinian people.

A study showed that many Arab citizens of Israel are afraid. About 60% are afraid of being bothered. 10% have been bothered before.

Daood said that this is bad for Israel. He said that people are in pain and scared since October 7. He thinks that people are losing their kindness.

He also said that they have had bad times before. But they always find a way to get better. They want to show that there is another way to live together.

Vera Deek is an Arab Christian. She used to be a teacher. She watched children making puppets in Jaffa. She said they believe in living together in peace. That is why she brought her daughter.

She said that the problem is not with the children. It is hard to live a normal life. So many people have died or are still dying.

Many Arab citizens of Israel lost friends and family. Some died in Gaza. Some died in the attacks on October 7.

Four people died when a rocket from Gaza hit a village. This village was in the Negev desert.

Some Arab citizens of Israel helped after the attacks. They were paramedics. Some of them were killed by Hamas.

The Bedouin tribes in the Negev helped a lot. They looked for missing Israelis. They were some of the first to help.","It is difficult now to say something that is not about revenge or destroying Gaza. If you say something different, people may think you are the enemy.

For example, if you write ""God help Gaza, and the children in Gaza,"" you might be in trouble.

After the attacks on October 7th, some important Arab Israelis were arrested.

In October, a singer named Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested for a short time. She wrote ""Only God wins"" and showed a Palestinian flag on Facebook.

Some political leaders were also arrested. They were planning a protest against the war.

An organization called Standing Together has created a special phone line. It is for people who are being bothered or harassed. This includes both Palestinians and Jewish people.

A recent survey showed that almost 60% of Arab Israelis are scared of being bothered. 10% have already been bothered.

Daood said that this is bad for Israeli society, especially for Jewish society. People are in pain and feel very scared since October 7th. This has made people lose their humanity.

He said that they have had many bad times before, but they always recovered. They are trying to show that there is a better way.

Vera Deek is an Arab Christian. She used to be a teacher. She was watching children make puppets and posters in Jaffa.

She said they believe in living together peacefully. That is why she brought her daughter there. But she thinks the problem is not with the children.

She said it is hard to live a normal life when so many people have died or are still dying.

Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and family in Gaza. They have also lost people in the attacks on October 7th.

Some of the first people who died were in a Bedouin village. A rocket from Gaza hit the village in the Negev desert.

Some Arab Israelis helped after the ground attacks. They were paramedics and other helpers. Some of them were killed by Hamas.

The Bedouin tribes in the Negev were among the first to help. They made teams to look for missing Israelis.","It is a difficult time for everyone. If you are a famous person, you must be careful what you say. If you don't say you want revenge, people may think you are the enemy. Even saying ""God help the children in Gaza"" can cause problems.

"There was a familiar sense of misery for many travellers in the week before Christmas as hundreds of trains were cancelled, motorways were closed and ferry passengers queued for miles waiting to board their ships. But it doesn’t have to be this way, transport campaigners say, as politicians and transport bosses have the power to ease some of the problems facing travellers. There is more gloom to come in the short term, according to the RAC, with Boxing Day traffic surging, and the prospect of dangerous winds in Scotland and northern England. Around 21 million people drove to visit family or friends before Christmas, and thousands more took flights or trains as what has become known as the great Christmas getaway gained momentum. Storm Pia caused disruption to rail and road in Scotland and northern England on Wednesday. Eurostar workers in France took industrial action the following day, and the knock-on effect was huge demand for ferry services. Motorists queued for 90 minutes during peak times. Saturday was expected to be the busiest day of the year on the roads, according to the RAC and Inrix, with 20% more car journeys than last Christmas weekend. On Boxing Day they expect drivers on the M25 to face 50-minute delays, and on 27 December journeys in busy areas of the UK will be 25% longer. On Saturday Port of Dover Travel reported a 90-minute wait at French border controls as traffic built up after a surge in ferry bookings in the wake of Thursday’s Eurotunnel disruption. And the Met Office is warning of high winds in Scotland, northern England and north Wales today, with possible power cuts and flying debris. Even though the weather may be out of the control of ministers and rail chiefs, they have other ways of easing the burden on travellers, according to the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC). National Highways removed 1,000 miles of roadworks on 19 December – “an early Christmas present” for drivers during the festive getaway. They will be back on 2 January. Widespread engineering works are planned for the rail network, although Network Rail said it was carrying out less work than usual, and no trains run on Christmas Day. In London, Paddington station is shut until Wednesday for HS2 works, while King’s Cross is shut today and Victoria station is not running Southeastern services until 2 January.","Many people were sad before Christmas.

"And passengers will be gambling with services by operators such as Avanti West Coast, which cut services in December and has seen 32% of services cancelled or severely delayed. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Michael Solomon Williams, CBT campaigns manager. “It’s not rational any more to distinguish between commuter travel and leisure travel.” Since the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week, he said. “People work weekends, go to football matches. There are all sorts of reasons why we need more services at weekends and Christmas, when people travel around the country more than any other time. “Another time makes more sense, like the second week of January, or on a Monday, for example.” He added that another balm for travellers would be the creation of Great British Railways, announced by the government in May 2021 but mothballed in October 2022. And passengers are being told to pay an extra 4.9% on rail fares in the new year. “They could have frozen fares the way they have with fuel duty for the last 13 years,” Solomon Williams said. “The cost of travelling by train has gone up at twice the rate of driving.” Oliver Lord, head of CCC, said that disrupting services on the busiest travel days of the year meant people were more likely to choose to take the car, adding to congestion. “A third of rail use now is on leisure,” he said. “If the three or four times a year a family wants to use trains to get out of town, and their experience is engineering works, a rail replacement bus service and journeys that take three times as long, what will they think? “It’s a great opportunity for the government to make a strategic decision,” Lord added. “If we said the first week or two of January was a time when businesses and corporations could do things a bit differently, with more working from home, that would be a great new year’s resolution from the government.” Travellers who have faced cancellations or delays should make sure they claim compensation, said Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which? Travel. “Sadly, it seems as though serious travel disruption over the festive period is becoming increasingly commonplace, with travellers once again facing the misery of cancelled trains as they try to make it home in time for Christmas,” she said.","People who use trains might have problems. The train company, Avanti West Coast, had fewer trains in December. Many of their trains were late or cancelled.

Michael Solomon Williams works for CBT. He said this is not good. He thinks we should not only think about people who travel to work.

He said that fewer people travel to work now since the pandemic. The pandemic is when the virus made many people sick. Now, people also travel on weekends. They go to football games. People travel a lot at Christmas time. We need more trains then. January is a better time to do train repairs, or maybe Mondays.

He also said that Great British Railways would help. The government said they would make it in 2021. But they stopped working on it in 2022.

Train tickets will cost 4.9% more next year. Michael Solomon Williams said the government could have kept the prices the same. They do this with fuel for cars. Train tickets cost much more than driving a car.

Oliver Lord is the head of CCC. He said that if trains stop running when people want to travel, they will use their cars. This will make more traffic.

He said that many people use trains for fun now. Families want to use trains to go on trips. But if the trains are not working, or they need to take a bus, they will not like it. The trips will take too long.

Oliver Lord thinks the government can do something. He said that businesses could let people work from home in January. This would help people travel easier.

Naomi Leach works for Which? Travel. She said that if your train is late or cancelled, you should ask for money back. She said that trains are often cancelled at Christmas. People want to go home for Christmas, but it is difficult.","Some train companies like Avanti West Coast are not running many trains. They stopped some trains in December. A lot of their trains are late or canceled. This is bad for people who want to travel.

Michael Solomon Williams works for CBT. He said this does not need to happen. He thinks it is not right to separate travel for work and travel for fun.

He said that after the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week. Now, people travel on weekends and for events. We need more trains on weekends and holidays like Christmas. People travel more around the country at these times. He thinks that it is better to reduce train service at other times such as the second week of January or on Mondays.

He also said that Great British Railways would help travelers. The government announced it in 2021, but stopped working on it in 2022.

Train tickets will cost 4.9% more next year. Mr. Williams said the government could have stopped the price from going up, like they did with fuel prices for cars. He said train tickets are getting more expensive faster than driving.

Oliver Lord works for CCC. He said that when trains are not running on busy days, people will drive cars instead. This makes traffic worse.

He said that many people use trains for fun now. If a family wants to take the train a few times a year but the trains are not working well, they will not like it. They will think the train is slow and bad.

Mr. Lord said that the government could make a good plan. He said that businesses could let people work from home for the first few weeks of January. This would be a good idea for the new year.

"A person has died in Scotland after falling ill with E coli, in what appears to be the first death linked to an outbreak that has affected at least 30 people. The UK Health Security Agency said the death “has been associated with this outbreak” and added later that it occurred in Scotland, but was unable to provide more information about the case. The agency said that as of 27 December there had been 30 confirmed cases in England and Scotland linked to an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), which first emerged in July. The cases involved children as young as seven and those aged up to 81, and most cases had occurred in December. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland announced a precautionary recall of four cheeses made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese on Christmas Eve due to possible E coli contamination. It added a fifth product, which is sold by Waitrose, to the recall list on 27 December. “Epidemiological and food chain investigations have identified links between some of the identified cases and a number of unpasteurised cheeses produced by a business in England,” the agency said. “UKHSA is continuing to follow up cases to identify any common links, including determining whether cases ate or came into contact with the recalled cheeses.” The products affected by the recall are: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild &amp; Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese. Amy Douglas, the agency’s incident director for gastrointestinal infections and food safety division, urged people who suspected they may have been infected not to travel over the holiday season. “There have been at least 30 confirmed cases of this specific outbreak strain of Stec in the UK,” she said. “Symptoms of Stec include severe diarrhoea (including bloody diarrhoea), stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, you can take steps to avoid passing it on to family and friends over the festive period.","Someone has died in Scotland. They were sick with E coli.

The agency said that on December 27th, there were 30 people with E coli. These people were in England and Scotland. The E coli is called Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec). It started in July.

Some sick people are children, as young as seven. Other sick people are old, up to 81 years old. Most people got sick in December.

The Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland said something about cheese. They said people should not eat some cheeses. The cheeses are made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese. This happened on Christmas Eve because the cheese might have E coli.

They added another cheese to the list on December 27th. This cheese is sold by Waitrose.

The agency said they found a connection. Some sick people ate cheese from a business in England. The cheese was not heated to kill germs.

The UKHSA is still checking the cases. They want to find out how people got sick. They want to know if the sick people ate the cheese that was recalled.

These are the cheeses that people should not eat: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild & Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese.

Amy Douglas works for the agency. She is in charge of food safety. She said that if people think they are sick, they should not travel. This is especially important during the holidays.

She said that at least 30 people have this E coli. The E coli is a special type of Stec.

Stec can make you very sick. You might have bad diarrhea, sometimes with blood. You might have stomach pain, throw up, and have a fever. If you have diarrhea and are throwing up, be careful.

"The Middle East has been slipping towards the precipice of a regional war ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the ferocious Israeli response in Gaza. The past week has shown how the cliff edge keeping it from that abyss could quickly crumble away. Within hours of the outbreak of the Gaza war, the Hezbollah Shia militia in Lebanon began to fire on northern Israeli towns and villages in solidarity with Palestinians, triggering Israeli air strikes in response, and Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea with real or perceived Israeli connections. The US moved two aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups to the region as American bases in Syria and Iraq came under repeated attacks from Iran-affiliated groups, drawing swift retaliation from Washington. At the same time the West Bank erupted in protests at the bombing of civilians in Gaza and extremist Jewish settlers quickly sought to ride the wave of Israeli anger by seizing Palestinian land and terrorising its residents. Each of these theatres of conflict has the potential to ignite a much-feared Middle East conflagration, and the past few days have demonstrated just how easily escalation, intended or not, could bring Israel into open confrontation with Iran, and suck in the US too. An Israeli airstrike just outside Damascus killed a senior figure in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for military liaison between Syria and Iran. After Mousavi’s death last Monday, the IRGC issued a statement declaring the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”. Tehran’s Houthi allies have meanwhile have been firing on the US-led “Prosperity Guardian” naval task force assembled to protect shipping in the Red Sea. American warships shot down dozens of drones and also a handful of ballistic missiles. US Central Command issued a statement to say that Washington had “every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran”.","After the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the Middle East became more dangerous. Israel attacked Gaza very strongly. This made the Middle East close to a big war.

The past week showed that things can get worse very fast.

When the war in Gaza started, Hezbollah in Lebanon started shooting at towns in Israel. They wanted to help the Palestinians. Israel then attacked Lebanon with planes.

Also, the Houthi group in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea. They thought the ships were connected to Israel.

The United States sent two big ships to the area. These ships had planes and soldiers. American bases in Syria and Iraq were attacked by groups that work with Iran. The United States then attacked back quickly.

At the same time, people in the West Bank protested. They were angry about the bombing of people in Gaza. Some Jewish people tried to take Palestinian land. They scared the people who lived there.

Each of these problems could start a big war in the Middle East. The past few days showed that it is easy for things to get worse. Israel could fight with Iran. And the United States could get involved too.

Israel attacked a place near Damascus. They killed Sayyed Razi Mousavi. He was a leader from Iran who helped Syria.

After Mousavi died, Iran said they would punish Israel for this. They called Israel a bad name.

The Houthi group in Yemen is friends with Iran. They shot at ships in the Red Sea. These ships are part of a group called ""Prosperity Guardian."" This group is led by the United States and protects ships.

American ships shot down many drones and missiles. The United States said that Iran helped the Houthi group with these attacks.","Since the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7th, the Middle East has become more dangerous. Israel's response in Gaza has made things worse. The region is close to a big war.

Soon after the war in Gaza started, Hezbollah in Lebanon started shooting at towns in northern Israel. They wanted to support the Palestinians. Israel then attacked Lebanon with planes.

Also, Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea. They thought these ships were connected to Israel.

The US sent two big ships with planes to the area. American bases in Syria and Iraq were attacked many times by groups connected to Iran. The US attacked back quickly.

At the same time, people in the West Bank protested the bombing of people in Gaza. Some Jewish settlers tried to take advantage of the situation. They took Palestinian land and scared people.

Each of these situations could start a big war in the Middle East. The last few days have shown how easily things can get out of control. Israel could fight openly with Iran, and the US could be pulled into the war too.

An Israeli plane attacked a place near Damascus. It killed Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a leader from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He helped Syria and Iran work together on military matters.

After Mousavi died last Monday, the IRGC said that Israel would pay for this. They called Israel a ""savage"" regime.

Iran's allies, the Houthis, are shooting at ships in the Red Sea. These ships are part of a US-led group called ""Prosperity Guardian."" This group is there to protect ships.

"If a US warship is struck, Joe Biden would be under intense pressure to deliver a decisive response, as he enters an election year with his tenure hanging in the balance and Republicans looking to focus on any trace of weakness. On Thursday, a former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, wrote a commentary in a US newspaper expressing the view of many on the hawkish end of the security establishments in both the Israel and the US that they are doomed to fight Iranian proxies indefinitely until Iran is taken on directly. “The evil empire of Iran must be brought down,” Bennett argued in the Wall Street Journal. “The US and Israel must set the clear goal of bringing down Iran’s evil regime. Not only is this possible. It is vital for the safety and security of the Middle East – and the entire civilised world.” On Friday, the UN security council convened to discuss violence on the West Bank, but the session was quickly drawn into a discussion of a regional war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, dismissed the issue of settler violence in the West Bank as a distraction from the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon. “The situation in northern Israel is reaching a point of no return,” Erdan said, echoing an increasingly frequent warning from Israeli officials that their country would take matters into its own hands, possibly by carving out a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. “If these attacks continue, I reiterate the situation will escalate and may lead to a full-scale war. Lebanon must be held accountable for the aggression carried out from its territory,” the Israeli envoy said. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, a UN assistant secretary-general, told security council members that, while most of the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been around the border, some strikes were going deeper into each other’s territory, “raising the spectre of an uncontained conflict with devastating consequences for the people of both countries”. Khiari added that “the risk of miscalculation and further escalation is increasing as the conflict in Gaza continues”.","If a US ship is hit, Joe Biden will have a problem. He will need to react strongly. It is an election year for him. Some people think he is weak. Republicans want to show his weakness.

Naftali Bennett is an ex-leader of Israel. He wrote in a US newspaper. He said many people think like him. They think Israel and the US must fight Iranian groups for a long time. They think they must fight Iran directly.

Bennett said Iran is bad. He said the US and Israel must stop Iran. He said this is important for the Middle East. He said it is important for the world.

Gilad Erdan is Israel's ambassador. He said the West Bank violence is not the main problem. He said Hezbollah in Lebanon is a bigger threat.

Erdan said the situation in north Israel is bad. Israeli leaders say they may act alone. They may make a safe area in south Lebanon.

Erdan said if the attacks keep happening, the situation will get worse. He said it could lead to a big war. He said Lebanon must be responsible for the attacks from its land.

Mohamed Khaled Khiari works for the UN. He told the UN that Israel and Hezbollah are fighting. Some attacks are going far into each other's land. This could cause a big war. It would be very bad for both countries.

Khiari said the fighting in Gaza makes things more dangerous. He said it is easier to make mistakes. He said the situation could get much worse.","If a US ship is attacked, Joe Biden will have a hard time. People will want him to act strongly. He is running for president again. Republicans will say he is weak if he doesn't do much.

Naftali Bennett used to be the leader of Israel. He wrote an article in a newspaper. He said that Israel and the US will keep fighting Iran's friends. He thinks they need to fight Iran directly.

Bennett said Iran is bad and must be stopped. He said the US and Israel should try to remove Iran's leaders. He believes this is important for safety in the Middle East and the world.

The UN talked about violence in the West Bank on Friday. But the meeting became about a bigger war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, said the West Bank violence is not the main problem. He said the real danger is Hezbollah in Lebanon.

He said if the attacks continue, there could be a big war. He said Lebanon is responsible for the attacks from its land.

Mohamed Khaled Khiari works for the UN. He told the UN that Israel and Hezbollah are shooting at each other. Some attacks are going far into each other's land. He said this could cause a big war that is hard to stop. It would be very bad for both countries.

"Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, expressed the uneasiness of the Arab world that in the absence of “bold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions” to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, “the alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, the UN estimates that 304 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including 79 children, along with four Israelis, three of them soldiers. Four more Israelis were killed in West Jerusalem in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on 30 November. One of the dead was mistakenly shot by an Israeli soldier. The disproportionate number of Palestinian dead showed that Israeli forces have been conducting an overkill campaign in an effort to deter an uprising in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza, argued Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “The Israeli mindset is that they think they are preventing a third Intifada,” Elgindy said. “But I think the way they’re operating, they’re probably more like causing one.” He pointed to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a particularly volatile element in the combustible state of the region. Overwhelmingly blamed by Israelis for the security lapses that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, Netanyahu faces a fall from power, but only when the fighting ends, or at least lessens in intensity. An escalation, on the other hand, could keep him in his post. “It is Netanyahu, frankly, who is dictating the terms on all fronts – in Gaza, on the Lebanon border, across the region – for Netanyahu’s reasons. This is his war,” Elgindy said. He added: “ I think every day that this goes on, you get closer to regional expansion of this whole mess.”","Lana Nusseibeh is from the United Arab Emirates. She talked about the problems in the Middle East. She said the Arab world is worried.

She said that people need to make important decisions. These decisions might be hard. If they don't, the problems will get worse. The problems in Gaza could spread. They could spread to the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other places.

Hamas attacked on October 7. After that, many people died in the West Bank. The UN says that 304 Palestinians died. 79 of them were children. Four Israelis also died. Three of them were soldiers.

On November 30, some Palestinian men attacked in Jerusalem. Four more Israelis died. One person was killed by mistake. An Israeli soldier shot him.

Khaled Elgindy works at the Middle East Institute. He said that many more Palestinians died than Israelis. He thinks Israel is using too much force. He said Israel wants to stop a big fight in the West Bank. This fight would be to help Gaza.

Elgindy thinks Israel's actions are making things worse. He said they might cause a big fight. This fight is called an Intifada.

He said Benjamin Netanyahu is making the region more dangerous. Many Israelis think Netanyahu made mistakes. They think he is the reason Hamas attacked.

Netanyahu might lose his job. But this will only happen when the fighting stops. If the fighting gets worse, he could stay in his job.

Elgindy said Netanyahu is in charge. He is making decisions about Gaza and Lebanon. He is also making decisions for the whole region. Elgindy said this is Netanyahu's war.

Elgindy thinks the problems will spread. He said the region is getting closer to a bigger war every day.","Lana Nusseibeh works for the United Arab Emirates. She said that the Arab world is worried. If we don't make big, hard choices, the problems in the area will get worse.

On October 7th, Hamas attacked. After that, the United Nations (UN) says that many people have died in the West Bank. About 304 Palestinians have died, including 79 children. Also, four Israelis have died, three were soldiers.

Four more Israelis died in Jerusalem on November 30th. Palestinian men with guns attacked them. One of the people who died was shot by mistake by an Israeli soldier.

Khaled Elgindy works at the Middle East Institute. He said that many more Palestinians have died than Israelis. This shows that Israeli soldiers are using too much force. They want to stop people in the West Bank from helping Gaza.

Elgindy said that Israel wants to stop another big uprising. They think they are preventing an “Intifada”. But the way they are acting might cause one.

He said that Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel, makes things worse. Many Israelis think Netanyahu made mistakes that allowed the Hamas attack to happen. Netanyahu might lose his job, but not until the fighting stops or gets better.

If the fighting gets worse, Netanyahu could stay in power. Elgindy said that Netanyahu is in charge of everything. He decides what happens in Gaza, near Lebanon, and in the whole area. This is his war.

Elgindy also said that every day the fighting continues, the problems are more likely to spread to other countries.","Lana Nusseibeh is from the United Arab Emirates.

Elgindy also talked about Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu is the leader of Israel. Elgindy thinks Netanyahu is making the area more dangerous. Many Israelis think Netanyahu made mistakes. They think he did not protect Israel well enough before the Hamas attack. Because of this, he might lose his job. But he will only lose his job after the fighting stops or gets better. If the fighting gets worse, he might stay in charge.

Elgindy said that Netanyahu is in control of everything. He is in control in Gaza, on the border with Lebanon, and in other places. Elgindy said that this is ""Netanyahu's war.""

"A court in South Korea has approved an arrest warrant for the country’s suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached over his ill-fated decision to impose martial law early this month, investigators said. Yoon’s decision to declare martial law late on 3 December plunged Asia’s fourth-biggest economy into its worst political crisis for decades and caused concern in Washington. Yoon was forced to lift the order just six hours later after MPs forced their way into parliament to vote it down. The corruption investigation office confirmed that a court in Seoul had approved the warrant, but it was not clear if police would be able to execute it. “The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol … were issued this morning,” the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for Yoon, condemned the move. “The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid,” he said in a statement. Soon after investigators said they had raided the army’s counterintelligence offices as part of the growing martial law probe. “The emergency martial law investigation team of the Corruption Investigation Office is conducting a search and seizure operation at the Counterintelligence Command this afternoon,” investigators said in a statement. Yoon has so far refused to cooperate with the investigation into his martial law order. He has failed to report to investigators for questioning over allegations of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion, and his presidential security service has prevented court-ordered searches of his office and residence. Yoon also faces charges of insurrection – a crime that can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty and one of the few charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. An official from the corruption investigation office said Yoon’s refusal to be questioned had prompted the warrant request. “The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime,” the official said. The warrant is valid until 6 January, he said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.","A court in South Korea said yes to arresting the president.

"Media reports said an imminent arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would seek to coordinate with the presidential security service. Technically, anyone obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant could be arrested. But under South Korean law, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it is unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces arrest. It is the first time an arrest warrant has been issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media. Police were deployed early on Tuesday outside Yoon’s residence in central Seoul in an attempt to prevent unrest. Yoon’s supporters and protesters calling for his removal have staked out his residence, with local media showing images of altercations between the two camps overnight. “Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?” Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon’s residence to show they were doing their work diligently and fairly. Park Sung-min, president of the Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant was probably an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with the investigation. The acting leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president was inappropriate, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the national assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December over his imposition of martial law. The constitutional court has 180 days from that date to decide whether to confirm the impeachment or reinstate Yoon, whose two-and-a-half years in office have been marred by scandal and policy deadlock. The martial law order triggered weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to facilitate the investigation into his predecessor.","Here is the text rewritten into CEFR A2 level English:

"In the wake of the April 2019 fire that devastated Notre Dame, the French president Emmanuel Macron promised that the monument would be rebuilt with a “contemporary gesture”. There followed all manner of madcap ideas: a glass spire; a 300ft carbon-fibre flame; a swimming pool on the roof; a covered garden. In the end, Notre Dame was restored to its original former glory and ceremonially reopened this month. Now, however, the planned “contemporary gesture” has been revealed – and has sparked a bitter row. The French artist Claire Tabouret has been chosen to design new stained glass windows depicting Pentecostal scenes, to be installed in the chapels on the south side of the medieval church. Tabouret was among 100 artists who took part in a competition to replace the existing six windows installed by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1844 – even though the windows were not damaged in the 2019 fire. Designs submitted by Tabouret, 43, a figurative artist whose work featured in the Vatican pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year and who now lives in Los Angeles, show scenes of people in prayer in shades of red, turquoise, yellow and pink. She will work with master glassmakers at the Atelier Simon-Marq, a glass workshop founded in Reims in 1640, to recreate the drawings in glass. The plan to replace the 19th-century chapel windows, which feature geometric designs described as having more historic than aesthetic value, has enraged critics. The 1964 Venice Charter, which codifies guidelines for preserving French buildings, states: “Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation,” and that “the valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected”. In July, the national committee for heritage and architecture at France’s ministry of culture unanimously opposed the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows, prompting one artist to withdraw his designs from the competition. The Académie des Beaux-Arts has also opposed the replacing of the windows.","In April 2019, there was a big fire at Notre Dame. Notre Dame is a very important church in France. The fire hurt the church a lot.

"In a statement last year, it wrote: “[The members of the academy] are concerned that the announcement of a competition for the creation of contemporary stained glass windows, which they support in principle, involves replacing the non-figurative windows ... The fire spared these windows. “The Académie des Beaux-Arts hopes that other locations, starting with the North Tower, will be considered for this commission for contemporary stained glass.” However, the plan, expected to cost more than €4m (£3.3m), has the approval of the president, the archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, and the church authorities. At a press conference after the announcement of her selection, Tabouret, a graduate of Paris’s prestigious École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, said she was “excited” by the challenge but aware of the controversy. “I’ve read about the different opinions of people because I want to understand their arguments and also to take an approach that is open and two-way. I find it a fascinating debate,” she said. She wanted to create stained glass windows that would have “the right presence … without imposing themselves on visitors”. Didier Rykner, a French journalist, art historian and founder of La Tribune de l’Art, a magazine dedicated to preserving France’s heritage, has described the idea of replacing the windows as “totally ludicrous”. He has launched a petition against the plan that has almost 250,000 signatures. “The president of the republic has decided on his own, without any regard for the heritage law or Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, to replace the stained glass windows in six out of the seven chapels on the south aisle with contemporary creations, after organising a competition,” it reads. “The stained glass windows in Notre Dame designed by Viollet-le-Duc were created as a coherent whole. It is a genuine creation that the architect wanted to be faithful to the cathedral’s gothic origins. Who gave the head of state a mandate to alter a cathedral that does not belong to him, but to everyone? “Emmanuel Macron wants to put the stamp of the 21st century on Notre Dame de Paris.","The Academy said something last year. The members are worried. They support the idea of new, modern windows. But they do not want to remove the old windows.

The old windows are not pictures of people. The fire did not hurt these windows. The Academy wants the new windows in a different place. Maybe in the North Tower.

The plan will cost a lot of money. It will cost more than 4 million euros. The president, the archbishop, and the church like the plan.

A woman named Tabouret will make the windows. She went to a famous art school in Paris. She is happy about the work. But she knows some people do not like the idea.

Tabouret said she knows about the different opinions. She wants to understand what people think. She wants to talk to people about it. She wants to make windows that are good. They should not be too strong for people to see.

Didier Rykner is a journalist and art expert. He thinks it is a bad idea to change the windows. He started a paper people can sign to say no. Almost 250,000 people have signed it.

Rykner said the president decided by himself. He did not think about the rules about old buildings. He wants to change the windows in six chapels. He wants to put new, modern windows there.

The old windows were made by Viollet-le-Duc. He made them to fit the cathedral. He wanted the windows to be like the old Gothic style. Rykner asks who told the president he could change the cathedral. The cathedral belongs to everyone, not just the president.

Emmanuel Macron wants to show that Notre Dame is from the 21st century.","The Academy said something last year. They said they like the idea of new stained glass windows. But they are worried. The plan is to replace some old windows.

These old windows are not pictures of people. They were not damaged in the fire. The Academy thinks the new windows should go in another place. Maybe the North Tower is a good place.

The plan will cost more than 4 million euros. The president, the archbishop, and church leaders agree with the plan.

A woman named Tabouret will make the new windows. She went to a good school in Paris. She said she is happy about the work. But she knows some people do not like the plan.

She said she is reading about what people think. She wants to understand why they feel that way. She wants to talk to people and listen to them. She thinks it is an interesting discussion.

She wants to make windows that look good. She does not want the windows to be too strong or hard to look at.

Didier Rykner is a French writer and art expert. He thinks it is a bad idea to change the windows. He started a list of names against the plan. Almost 250,000 people have signed it.

The list says the president made the decision alone. He did not think about the rules for old buildings. He wants to replace the windows in six chapels. These chapels are on the south side of the church.

The old windows were made by Viollet-le-Duc. He made them all to look good together. He wanted them to be like the old, tall churches.

Who said the president could change the church? The church belongs to everyone, not just him.

Emmanuel Macron wants to show that Notre Dame is from the 21st century.","The Académie des Beaux-Arts said something last year. They talked about a new contest. The contest is for new stained glass windows. The academy likes the idea of new windows. But they are worried.

The new windows might replace old ones. These old windows are not pictures of people. The fire did not damage these windows.

The Académie wants the new windows somewhere else. They think the North Tower would be a good place.

This plan will cost a lot of money. It will cost more than 4 million euros. The president agrees with the plan. The archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, agrees too. The church leaders also agree.

A woman named Tabouret won the contest. She went to a good school in Paris. It is called École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. She is happy about the challenge.

But she knows some people do not like the idea. She said she wants to understand everyone's opinion. She wants to talk to people about it. She thinks it is an interesting discussion.

She wants to make windows that are good. She wants them to be there, but not too noticeable. She does not want them to bother people who visit.

Didier Rykner is a journalist. He studies art history. He has a magazine about French history. It is called La Tribune de l’Art. He thinks the idea of replacing the windows is very bad.

He started a petition against the plan. Almost 250,000 people have signed it.

The petition says the president made this decision alone. He did not think about the rules about old buildings. He wants to replace the windows in six chapels. These chapels are on the south side. He wants new, modern windows.

The old windows were made by Viollet-le-Duc. He made them to fit together. They were made to look like the cathedral's old style.

The petition asks who gave the president permission. The cathedral belongs to everyone, not just him.

Emmanuel Macron wants to make Notre Dame look like it belongs in the 21st century.",0.7295200824737549,0.5,81.66796439628484,1.0,0.8166796439628485,0.6820665754788678,0.7574156522750854,0.6666666666666666,87.78163803145023,0.7,0.7878163803145023,0.7372995664187515,0.8239011764526367,0.8,80.80064171122997,0.7,0.7180064171122996,0.7806358645216456
"Perhaps a little modesty would be preferable.” The French heritage association Sites &amp; Monuments has threatened legal action if the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows goes ahead. Rykner told the Observer: “To remove windows that survived the fire undamaged and replace them with others is just absurd. I am not against contemporary windows per se but there is just no reason to replace these windows. Besides, money donated by people to renovate Notre Dame has already been spent on cleaning them. “It’s absolutely ridiculous. We’ve been told they will put the Viollet-le-Duc windows on display in a museum. They don’t belong in a museum – they belong in Notre Dame. It makes no sense for them to be on display anywhere other than the cathedral. Their only interest is in situ.” He added: “I don’t see why Macron has such a say over what happens to a heritage building. This is just a vanity project. “As for the church authorities approving this – we should remember that the greatest vandalism done to French churches and religious buildings in the 60s and 70s was carried out … by the church. They have no taste.” Stéphane Bern, Macron’s former heritage tsar, voiced his opposition to the plan in an interview with Ouest France newspaper. “I have nothing against Claire Tabouret or contemporary stained glass ... But I am in favour of them when the old ones are destroyed or damaged. You can’t remove stained glass windows that are listed as historic monuments,” Bern said. “Why does the state set itself free from the rules it imposes on others? Just because the president wants it that way?” Simon-Marq will make the six new windows, which will reach 7m high and cover a total surface area of 121 sq metres, and are expected to be installed in 2026. Tabouret said she would be incorporating motifs from Viollet-le-Duc’s windows in the stained glass.","The group ""Sites & Monuments"" is angry. They don't want the old windows of Notre Dame to be taken out. The windows were made by Viollet-le-Duc.

Mr. Rykner said it is silly to remove the good windows. He wants to keep them. He said the money to fix Notre Dame was already used to clean the old windows.

Mr. Rykner said the old windows should stay in Notre Dame. He does not want them in a museum. He thinks they belong in the church.

He also said that President Macron should not decide what happens to the old building. He thinks Macron only wants to change the windows to show off.

Mr. Rykner said the church leaders have made bad choices before. He said they do not have good taste.

Mr. Stéphane Bern also does not like the plan. He used to work with Macron on old buildings.

Mr. Bern said new windows are okay if the old ones are broken. But the old windows are not broken. He said you cannot remove old windows that are important.

He asks why the government can break its own rules. He thinks it is only because the president wants it.

Ms. Simon-Marq will make the new windows. They will be very big. They will be put in place in 2026.

Ms. Tabouret said the new windows will look like the old windows. She will use some of the same ideas.","Some people think the plan is not good.

A French group called Sites & Monuments is angry. They might go to court. This is because of the plan to take out old windows from Notre Dame.

Mr. Rykner said it is silly to take out good windows. The fire did not hurt them. He said they want to put in new windows. He likes new windows, but he thinks these old windows should stay.

People gave money to fix Notre Dame. Some of that money was used to clean these old windows.

Mr. Rykner thinks it is wrong to move the old windows to a museum. He says they belong in the church, Notre Dame. He thinks they should stay where they are.

He does not understand why President Macron has so much power over the building. He thinks Macron wants this to show off.

The church leaders like the plan. But Mr. Rykner said the church damaged many old churches in the past. He thinks they do not have good taste.

Mr. Stéphane Bern used to work for President Macron. He also does not like the plan. He likes new glass art. But he thinks it should be used when the old glass is broken.

He said you cannot take out old glass windows that are important. He asked why the government can break its own rules. He thinks it is because the President wants it.

Ms. Simon-Marq will make the new windows. They will be very big. They will be ready in 2026.

Ms. Tabouret said the new windows will look a little like the old ones.","Some people think the plan is not good. A group called Sites & Monuments is angry. They might take legal action. This is because the plan is to remove some windows.

Rykner spoke to a newspaper. He said it is silly to remove the windows. The windows were not broken in the fire. New windows will replace them. Rykner is not against new windows. But he thinks these old windows should stay. People gave money to fix Notre Dame. Some of that money was used to clean these windows.

Rykner thinks it is ridiculous. He heard the old windows will go to a museum. But he thinks they should stay in Notre Dame. They belong in the cathedral. He believes the only right place for them is in their original location.

He also said Macron has too much control. Macron is making it about himself, not the building. Rykner does not understand why Macron can decide about a very old building.

The church leaders agreed to the plan. But Rykner remembers something. In the past, the church damaged many old buildings. They did this in the 1960s and 1970s. He thinks they don't have good taste.

Stéphane Bern used to be in charge of old buildings for Macron. He also disagrees with the plan. He spoke to a newspaper called Ouest France.

Bern said he likes new stained glass. But only when the old ones are broken. These old windows are historical. You cannot just remove them. The government makes rules for everyone. But the government is breaking its own rules. Is it just because the President wants it?

Simon-Marq will make the new windows. The windows will be very big, 7 meters tall. They will cover 121 square meters. They should be ready in 2026.

Tabouret is the artist. She said she will use designs from the old windows. She will put these designs in the new stained glass.",0.777087926864624,0.5,87.98242025316458,1.0,0.8798242025316456,0.7189707097987567,0.8210998773574829,0.6666666666666666,93.59902985074629,0.7,0.8459902985074628,0.7779189475105374,0.7506134510040283,0.8,86.41423458725184,0.7,0.7741423458725183,0.7749185989588488
"I was drawn to Jonathan Freedland’s article (‘How do we live in this terrible world?’ a reader asked me. Here’s the only answer I have, 20 December), as it is a question that’s continually on my mind. There’s much substance in his well-informed piece, though the ending’s quite simple and resonates with my own take: “Perhaps by accepting that it’s the only one we have and that it’s not always so terrible – that sometimes, even quite often, it can be rather beautiful.” One of my responses to this ever-present question is to have gratitude for what I call “magic moments” in nature – like this morning catching sight of the heron, almost invisible, being so amazingly camouflaged among the reeds by a stream; I said “good morning, heron” softly, but didn’t linger because I’ve come to realise that they don’t like being looked at for long. A few years ago, I made a book of Marvellous Mundane Magic for my then 10-year-old granddaughter, to demonstrate to her that magic wasn’t solely the property of wizards. She loved it and now she’s noting her own and giving them to me to make a new book. Even a short early-morning walk offers magic if your eyes and ears are open, even if it’s just hearing a winter robin or seeing herb robert still flowering by a path. Margaret Turner Exeter • Jonathan Freedland gave us “a few reasons to be hopeful” about living in this terrible world. Thank you – they are good reasons: drawing strength from those who “dare to swim against even the bleakest tides”, celebrating what is good, and remembering that this is the only world we have, and that it is often beautiful. These reasons all involve looking outwards, observing. A complementary way of being hopeful – and happy – is looking inwards and acting on our values. Alone, or with the help of activist citizen groups. Thinking back, that is what the suffragettes did, the anti-apartheid activists and many others who have made the world a better place.","I read an article by Jonathan Freedland. He asked: ""How do we live in this terrible world?"" I think about this question a lot.

His article was good. He said something simple. He said the world is the only one we have. He said it is not always terrible. Sometimes it is beautiful. I agree with him.

I try to be thankful for ""magic moments"" in nature. This morning, I saw a heron. It was hard to see because it looked like the reeds by the stream. I said, ""Good morning, heron."" I did not stay long. Herons do not like to be watched.

A few years ago, I made a book for my granddaughter. She was ten years old. The book was about ""Marvellous Mundane Magic."" I wanted to show her that magic is not just for wizards. She liked the book. Now she writes down her own magic moments. She gives them to me. I will make a new book.

Even a short walk can have magic. You just need to look and listen. You might hear a robin in winter. You might see a flower by the path.

Margaret Turner wrote about Jonathan Freedland's article. He gave us reasons to be hopeful. The world is terrible, but we can still hope. We can get strength from people who fight for what is right. We can be happy about good things. We can remember that this is our only world. It is often beautiful.

We can look outside and see these things. We can also look inside ourselves. We can act on what we believe is right. We can do it alone or with others. People who fought for women's rights did this. People who fought against apartheid did this too. They made the world better.","I read an article by Jonathan Freedland. It was called ""How do we live in this terrible world?""

"Our thanks to them for doing more than observing. And happy new year to all. Patrick and Alison Duncan Norton, North Yorkshire • The most important component of staying optimistic in these troubled times is positive action. When we look at the world in despair, we should ask ourselves: “What can I do to improve it?” The only way the world gets better is through lots of people showing more love, empathy and care. Especially at Christmas, there are ample opportunities to make a difference to someone’s life. A donation to a charity, a kind word to a stranger, a Christmas card sent to a neighbour. Picking up rubbish, volunteering, donating to a food bank. It might not be much as a single deed, but imagine 9 billion little actions. Wow! Here’s to a better future for all. Hanna Pennig Forglen, Aberdeenshire • I cannot hope – but I can, and do, take it one day at a time. Being in the now opens me up to the small joys that everyday life offers. A toddler on the bus who smiles at me; a dog waiting patiently outside a supermarket; a sunny day. I have no agency to change the big things, but I am in control of how I respond to them. Lyn Dade Twickenham, London • Jonathan Freedland is helpful and encouraging in his reply to the question: “How do we live in this terrible world?” My own way of struggling with terrible news is to remind myself that wherever there is suffering, even of great magnitude, there are wonderful people struggling to alleviate it.

"As families in Taiwan prepare to gather for lunar new year celebrations in January, a game that will be released that month promises to offer some war-themed fun over the festive period. The board game 2045, developed by the Taiwanese company Mizo Games, invites players to participate in an imaginary Chinese invasion 20 years in the future. Players are given roles that include Taiwanese army officers, Chinese sleeper agents and volunteer citizen fighters. “We can’t predict the future, but if a conflict is unavoidable I hope this game gives people a chance to experience war on the tabletop before it reaches us,” KJ Chang, the founder of Mizo Games, told the Wall Street Journal. The game is being released at a time when China has increased its military pressure around the self-governing island. Taiwan has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China but Beijing regards it as part of its territory and has promised to “unify” it with China, using force if necessary. Observers do not know when, if ever, China will launch a military operation against Taiwan. But some analysts have pointed to the years around 2050 as a possible risk period. Xi Jinping, China’s leader and military commander-in-chief, has pledged to build a “world-class army” by the middle of the century, and 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic of China, is the date by which Beijing wants to achieve “national rejuvenation”. Mizo Games launched a crowdfunding campaign for their new product in August. Within months, it had raised NTD$4.1m (£99,468), surpassing its original target by more than 4,000%. 2045 is the latest in a series of entertainment products in Taiwan that focus on the threat of an attempted Chinese annexation. This year also saw the release of Zero Day, a Taiwanese government-funded television series that depicts a Chinese invasion. It also received support from Robert Tsao, a Taiwanese tech billionaire and supporter of Taiwan’s civil defence efforts. As well as receiving the first copies of the game, VIP backers of the crowdfunding campaign will receive extra Taiwan-themed products.","In January, families in Taiwan will celebrate Lunar New Year. A new game will also come out in January. The game is called ""2045"".

The game is about a war. It is about a possible attack from China in the future. The game is made by a company in Taiwan called Mizo Games.

In the game, players can be different people. They can be soldiers from Taiwan. They can be spies from China. They can also be citizens who are fighting.

KJ Chang is the person who started Mizo Games. He said the game lets people think about war. He hopes people can learn about war in a safe way.

China is putting more pressure on Taiwan. Taiwan is an island. It has its own government. But China thinks Taiwan is part of China. China wants to take over Taiwan, maybe with force.

No one knows when China might attack Taiwan. Some people think it could happen around the year 2050.

The leader of China, Xi Jinping, wants a very strong army. He wants it by the middle of the century. China will be 100 years old in 2049. China wants to be strong again by then.

Mizo Games asked people for money to make the game. They got a lot of money very fast. They got much more money than they asked for.

""2045"" is not the only thing in Taiwan about a possible attack. There is also a TV show called ""Zero Day"". It is also about an attack from China. The government of Taiwan helped to pay for the show.

"The tech entrepreneur and close adviser to Donald Trump Elon Musk has taken a stunning new public step in his support for the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), publishing a supportive guest opinion piece for the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that has prompted the commentary editor to resign in protest. The commentary piece in German was launched online on Saturday before being published on Sunday in the flagship paper of the Axel Springer media group, which also owns the US politics news site Politico. Musk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD’s extremist bent, and the essay expands on his post on his social media platform, X, on which he last week claimed that “only the AfD can save Germany”. Translated, Musk’s piece said: “The portrayal of the AfD as rightwing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021. Shortly after the piece was published online, the editor of the opinion section, Eva Marie Kogel, used the US tech mogul’s own platform to post on X that she had submitted her resignation. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion department at Welt and Wams. Today a text by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. Yesterday I submitted my resignation after printing,” she posted. She included a link to the Musk commentary article. The AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance and, like incoming president Donald Trump in relation to the US, is calling for mass deportations from Germany. Earlier in December, Musk not only posted in favor of AfD but the party’s hard line on immigration appeared to resonate with the incoming US vice-president, JD Vance, MSNBC reported. Senior Welt Group figures weighed in on Saturday. “Democracy and journalism thrive on freedom of expression.","Elon Musk is a businessman. He is a friend of Donald Trump.

The newspaper belongs to a company. This company also owns a news website called Politico.

In the article, Musk said AfD is not extreme. He said the leader of AfD, Alice Weidel, has a partner who is a woman from Sri Lanka. He asked if this sounds like Hitler.

But Germany's government thinks AfD might be extremist. They have been watching the party since 2021.

The editor who quit posted about it on X, which is Musk's social media platform. She said she liked her job. But she resigned after Musk's article was printed. She shared a link to the article.

"This includes dealing with polarising positions and classifying them journalistically,” the newspaper’s editor-in-chief designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, and Ulf Poschardt, who takes over as publisher on 1 January, told Reuters. They said discussion about Musk’s piece, which had about 340 comments several hours after it was published, was “very revealing”. Underneath Musk’s commentary, the newspaper published a response by Burgard. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally false,” he wrote, referencing the AfD’s desire to leave the European Union and seek rapprochement with Russia as well as appease China. Musk and Weidel both later posted a link to the article on X. The AfD backing from Musk, who also defended his right to weigh in on German politics due to his “significant investments”, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed late this fall. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority, but Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level:

"Dominique Pelicot will not appeal against his conviction for drugging and raping his wife and inviting strangers to rape her, his lawyer has said. Béatrice Zavarro said the former electrician, 72, who was jailed for the maximum 20 years this month, wished to spare his now ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot, a new ordeal but admitted there was also the risk a new trial in front of a public jury could mean a longer prison sentence. Pelicot and the 50 others who were all found guilty of rape or sexual assault after a three-and-a-half-month trial have until midnight on Monday to lodge an appeal. A statement from public prosecutor confirmed that 17 people had so far appealed against their convictions, adding that a new trial would be held in Nîmes towards the end of next year. Gisèle Pelicot, 72, a retired logistics manager, believes she may have been raped more than 200 times by her husband and other men between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after filming up the skirts of female shoppers in a supermarket near the couple’s home in the Provençal town of Mazan. Detectives subsequently found tens of thousands of videos of the abuse on his phone and a hard drive. On Monday, Zavarro said Dominique Pelicot had decided not to appeal against his conviction because to do so would “force Gisèle into a new ordeal and new confrontations, which [he] rejects”. Appealing against the guilty judgment, when Pelicot admitted the charges, would involve “running an unnecessary risk”, she added, as the accusations could be made more serious in the appeal court, where the case would be held in front of a public jury, potentially leading to a longer prison term. “It is time to put an end to this judicially,” Zavarro said on Monday. The marathon rape trial in Avignon was heard by a panel of five professional magistrates. The appeal court, which sits in the southern city of Nîmes, will require a new full trial within the next year. Gisèle Pelicot is not required to attend the appeal hearing but her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, indicated she was ready to do so.","Dominique Pelicot was in court. He was found guilty of a bad crime. He gave his wife drugs. He made strangers hurt her.

Dominique will not ask for another trial. He does not want to hurt his ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot, again. It would be hard for her. Also, a new trial could mean he stays in jail longer.

"“She has told us she will be there. Maybe not every day but she says she will go,” he said. She became an international feminist figurehead after insisting the trial be held in open court and the videos of her abuse shown in order that “shame changes sides”. The trial has caused much soul-searcing in France and calls to tighten French rape laws, including introducing the concept of “consent”, which is absent. The trial also threw a spotlight on attitudes towards the rape and sexual abuse of women in France, where 94% of reported rape cases are dropped without any action. “From Gisèle Pelicot’s point of view, there is no sentence that will give her back what she has lost,” Babonneau said. “All Gisèle Pelicot wanted is to have the accused convicted for what they did to her. As for the personal sentences, she respects the decision of the court and finds no solace in them.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

She is now famous all over the world for women's rights. This happened after her trial. She wanted the trial to be open. Everyone could see it. She also wanted the videos of what happened to her to be shown. She said this would make the people who hurt her feel ashamed.

The trial made many people in France think hard. They want to make the rape laws in France stronger. They want to add the idea of ""consent"" to the laws. Consent means saying ""yes."" Right now, the laws do not talk about consent.

The trial showed how people in France think about rape and hurting women. Many rape cases are dropped. This means that the police do not do anything about them. 94 out of 100 rape cases are dropped.

Babonneau said, ""Gisèle Pelicot will never get back what she lost. No punishment can fix that.""

He also said, ""Gisèle Pelicot wanted one thing. She wanted the people who hurt her to be found guilty. She is okay with what the court decided. It does not make her happy, but she accepts it.""","He told us that she will be there. Maybe she will not be there every day. But she said she will go.

She is now a famous feminist around the world. This is because she wanted her trial to be public. She wanted everyone to see the videos of what happened to her. She wanted the shame to be on the abusers, not on her.

The trial made people in France think a lot. People want to change the laws about rape in France. They want to add the idea of ""consent"" to the laws. ""Consent"" means saying yes to something. This idea is not in the French laws now.

The trial also showed how people in France think about rape and abuse of women. Many rape cases in France are stopped. About 94 out of 100 reported rape cases are stopped without anything happening.

"Work has begun to conserve and digitise one of the oldest paper documents still in existence on the island of Ireland. The ecclesiastical register, which dates back to the medieval period, is about 650 years old. It belonged to the former archbishop of Armagh Milo Sweteman. Its delicate pages are being repaired by experts at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni) as part of an initiative to rejuvenate and preserve some of the island of Ireland’s most important historical texts. Ecclesiastical registers contain copies or drafts of documents created by the archbishops’ administration work, including legal papers, official letters, correspondence, receipts and wills. The register belonging to Sweteman dates to his time in the senior clerical role from 1361 to 1380. Conservation work on the register of archbishop John Swayne, dated from 1418 to 1438, has already been completed and a digitised copy, along with a translated summary, are now available online. The conservation work on the Swayne books involved carefully detaching bindings dating from the 17th century, gently washing all the paper folios and then consolidating each piece of paper with a weak gelatine solution. Tears and losses in the paper were infilled with Japanese kozo paper before the books were rebound using 17th-century binding material. The work now under way on the Sweteman register involves the need to repair damage that resulted from previous conservation efforts dating back to the start of the 20th century when tracing paper was placed on the pages in an attempt to preserve them. The tracing paper was acidic and actually accelerated the corrosion of the ink and paper. It is now being removed using a specialist gel before being subjected to a low-pressure washing process. The same kozo paper and wheat starch paste repairs used for Swayne’s register are then being undertaken. Similar work is being carried out on a third register, dated between 1400 and 1418, that belonged to former archbishop Nicholas Fleming. Sarah Graham, head of conservation at Proni, explained that paper was extremely rare on the island of Ireland when the registers were compiled.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

Church books like this have copies of old papers. These papers were made by the archbishop. They are about laws, letters, and money. They also have old wills.

Sweteman's book is from when he was archbishop. That was from 1361 to 1380.

Another old book has already been fixed. It belonged to archbishop John Swayne. His book is from 1418 to 1438. You can see a copy of his book online. There is also a simple explanation of what it says.

To fix Swayne's book, they took it apart. They washed the paper very carefully. Then, they made the paper stronger. They used a special glue.

If the paper was torn, they used special paper to fix it. Then, they put the book back together. They used old materials from the 1600s.

Now, they are fixing Sweteman's book. It was damaged a long time ago. People tried to fix it before.

They used special paper to protect it. But the paper was bad. It made the book worse.

Now, they are taking off the bad paper. They use a special gel. Then, they wash the book.

They will use the same paper and glue to fix it. They used this for Swayne's book.

They are also fixing another old book. It belonged to archbishop Nicholas Fleming. It is from 1400 to 1418.

Sarah Graham works at Proni. She is in charge of fixing old papers. She said that paper was hard to find in Ireland a long time ago. That is when these books were written.","Work has started on an old paper document. This document is very old. It is one of the oldest paper documents in Ireland.

The document is about 650 years old. It is from the Middle Ages. It was owned by Milo Sweteman. He was an archbishop in Armagh.

The pages of the document are very delicate. Experts are fixing them. They work at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni). They are helping to save important old documents from Ireland.

These documents are called ecclesiastical registers. They have copies of papers from the archbishop. These papers include legal papers and letters. They also include receipts and wills.

Sweteman's register is from when he was archbishop. He was the archbishop from 1361 to 1380.

The experts already fixed another register. This register belonged to archbishop John Swayne. It is from 1418 to 1438. You can now see it online. There is also a simple explanation of it.

To fix Swayne's register, they took it apart. They cleaned each page with water. Then, they put a special liquid on the paper. This made the paper stronger. They fixed tears with special paper from Japan. Then, they put the book back together with old covers.

Now, they are working on Sweteman's register. They need to fix damage from before. People tried to save it a long time ago. They put thin paper on the pages. But this thin paper was bad for the document. It made the ink and paper get worse.

The experts are taking off the thin paper. They are using a special gel. Then, they will wash the pages gently. They will use the same Japanese paper and glue to fix it like they did for Swayne's register.

They are also working on a third register. This register belonged to archbishop Nicholas Fleming. It is from 1400 to 1418.

Sarah Graham works at Proni. She said that paper was rare in Ireland when these registers were made.","Work has started on an old paper document. It is one of the oldest in Ireland.

Now, they are taking off the thin paper. They are using a special gel. Then, they will wash the pages carefully.

They will use the same Japanese paper to fix it. They will also use wheat paste. This is how they fixed Swayne's book.

"It was a period that just predated the invention of the printing press when parchment from animal skins was still the preferred writing material. “Paper that pre-dates 1450 is particularly rare, it didn’t occur in Ireland for a couple of centuries after the register of Milo Sweteman or the register of John Swayne were completed,” said Graham. “We’ve done some research into the watermarks and know that the paper came from Italy and from Spain.” Graham said it was likely the archbishops imported the paper to Ireland during their travels around Europe. The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland is an effort to partially recreate the rich historical archive that was destroyed when the Public Record Office of Ireland in Dublin was set alight in June 1922 in the beginning of the Irish civil war. Graham emphasised the importance of preserving the centuries-old documents that do still exist. “The work that we do in conservation more broadly is really important to stabilise the collections so that they’re available to the public now, but they’re also available for generations to come, so that future generations are able to understand where they come from, what their history is, and the primary source of material is here and available to them,” she said.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

A long time ago, people did not have printing presses. They wrote on animal skins. This was before the year 1450.

Graham said paper from before 1450 is very special. It was not in Ireland for a long time. This was after two books were made. The books were called ""Register of Milo Sweteman"" and ""Register of John Swayne.""

Graham studied the paper. She looked at the watermarks. Watermarks are like small pictures in the paper. She learned the paper came from Italy and Spain.

"South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine has died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces. Seoul’s spy agency earlier on Friday confirmed Ukrainian reports that an injured North Korean soldier had been captured by Ukrainian forces, in what was likely to have been the first capture of its kind since Pyongyang sent combat forces to bolster Russian forces in the war. The South Korean national intelligence service said in a statement: “Through real-time information sharing with an allied country’s intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured.” The agency later said the captured soldier had died from his injuries. A photo of the soldier, who looked gaunt and appeared to have been injured, circulated on the Telegram messaging app, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. In his nightly video address on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said North Korean troops fighting in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s president said Russian troops were doing everything to ensure that North Korean soldiers were not taken prisoner by Kyiv. He said some North Korean soldiers had been captured by Ukrainian forces, but were hurt so badly they could not be saved. Earlier the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that special forces had captured the soldier in the Kursk region, where Ukraine has seized and held some territory. The outlet did not say when the capture took place, and there has been no confirmation from officials in Ukraine or North Korea, where the state media have not referred to the deployment of the country’s troops. Militarnyi said that if it was confirmed, the soldier would be the first North Korean combatant to have been taken by Ukrainian forces. As many as 11,000 soldiers from North Korea have been deployed to help Russia, months after Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defence pact that committed each country to come to the other’s aid if attacked. While the North could gain valuable battlefield experience, its poorly trained soldiers, fighting in unfamiliar territory, have quickly been exposed to the dangers of combat.","Here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

"Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known as the GUR, said on Thursday that North Korean troops were suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Kursk and facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks. The GUR said Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka had inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units and that North Korean troops also faced supply issues, including shortages of drinking water. This week Zelenskyy claimed that more than 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties. On Friday a White House spokesperson said 1,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the past week alone. “It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences,” John Kirby said. He described the North Korean troops’ offensive as “massed, dismounted assaults” and said Joe Biden was likely to approve another security assistance package for Ukraine in coming days. The deployment of North Korean soldiers marked a dramatic escalation in the war, which began almost three years ago, as the Kremlin turned to its ally to boost its forces. It was also seen as an attempt by Putin to broaden the conflict through the direct involvement in fighting of a third country. Slovakia, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that it would host peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, despite Ukraine’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Putin. On Thursday the Russian president said it was “acceptable” for the country to become a “platform” for dialogue over the conflict, which the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said he could end after he takes office in January. That prospect has raised concerns in Kyiv that a settlement could be imposed on terms favourable to Moscow, as Ukraine struggles on the battlefield.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

"At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina, his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul, were taking in the picture-perfect waters of Patong bay as they ate breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel on Boxing Day morning in 2004. “We were admiring the view and all of a sudden the water disappeared,” says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. “The locals thought, ‘This is fantastic.’ They were running around picking the fish up.” Now Giardina knows it’s a sign to flee to higher ground. About 550km to the south-west, a magnitude 9.15 earthquake had struck 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering what would become the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians among more than 230,000 people whose lives were lost across 14 countries – in some impact zones, the waves reached up to 3o metres above sea level. Twenty years on, Giardina’s memories of the disaster are as vivid as they were in its immediate aftermath. “It really feels like it was only yesterday,” he says of that initially deceptive morning. Within about half an hour the sea had returned to its normal level and settled, then it began to swirl, gently stirring up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A small amount of water – no more than 20cm – washed on to the road bordering the restaurant. “It didn’t look dangerous – we said, ‘We’re going to get wet,’” Giardina remembers. But when a car was washed towards the hotel, he began to run, leading Paul by the hand and then attempting to protect his son by holding him against a pillar inside the hotel. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind, throwing them over an internal wall and ripping Giardina’s clothes from his body.","Joe Giardina, his wife Evanna, and their son Paul were on vacation. Paul was 16 years old. They were in Phuket, near the beach. It was the morning of December 26, 2004. They were eating breakfast at their hotel. The hotel was near Patong Bay.

The sea looked beautiful. Joe said they were looking at the view. Suddenly, the water went away. The water went away very fast. Fish were on the sand. The fish were moving around because there was no water.

People were looking at the fish. They thought it was good. They were picking up the fish. Now Joe knows this was a sign. It was a sign to run to higher ground.

There was an earthquake. It was 550 km away. The earthquake was strong, with a magnitude of 9.15. It started a tsunami. It was the biggest tsunami ever.

Paul died in the tsunami. He was one of 26 Australians who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries. The waves were very big. Some waves were 30 meters high.

Joe remembers the tsunami very well. It feels like it was yesterday.

That morning, the sea came back. It looked normal again. Then, the water started to move around. It mixed up the sand. A pier near them started to float away. Some water came onto the road. It was only a little water, about 20 cm.

Joe thought they would just get wet. But then a car was pushed by the water. The car was moving towards the hotel. Joe started to run. He held Paul's hand. He tried to keep Paul safe. He held him against a pillar in the hotel.

Then, a big wave hit them. The wave was as high as their waists. It hit them from behind. It threw them over a wall. The wave took Joe's clothes off.","Joe Giardina, his wife Evanna, and their son Paul were on holiday. Paul was 16 years old. They were in Phuket, in Thailand. It was December 26, 2004.

Everything seemed fine. The sea looked beautiful. Then, something strange happened. Joe said, ""We were looking at the view. Suddenly, the water went away."" The water went down very fast. Fish were left on the sand. People were surprised. They went to the beach to look.

Joe said, ""The people who lived there thought it was good. They were picking up the fish."" Now Joe knows this was a warning. He knows it meant they should go to higher ground.

Far away, about 550 km, there was a big earthquake. It was under the sea. The earthquake was very strong. It caused a tsunami. A tsunami is a very big wave. This tsunami was the worst one ever.

Paul died in the tsunami. He was one of 26 Australians who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries. The waves were very high in some places, up to 30 meters.

A little water came onto the road. It was not very high. It was about 20 cm. Joe said, ""It did not look dangerous. We thought we would just get wet.""

But then, a car was pushed by the water towards the hotel. Joe knew they had to run. He took Paul's hand and ran. They went inside the hotel. Joe tried to keep Paul safe near a pillar. Then, a big wave of water hit them. It was very strong. It threw them over a wall. The water even pulled Joe's clothes off.","Joe Giardina, his wife Evanna, and their son Paul were on vacation. Paul was 16 years old. It was December 26, 2004. They were eating breakfast at their hotel in Phuket, Thailand. The hotel was near the beach.

Joe looked at the sea. He thought it was a beautiful morning. Suddenly, the water went away. The water level dropped very fast. Fish were left on the sand.

People were surprised. They did not think it was dangerous. They went to the beach to catch the fish. Joe Giardina now knows this was a warning. It meant they should go to higher ground.

There had been a big earthquake. It was about 550 kilometers away. The earthquake caused a tsunami. A tsunami is a very big wave. This tsunami was the worst in history.

Paul was one of many people who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries. The waves were very high in some places. They were 30 meters tall.

It has been twenty years since the tsunami. Joe Giardina remembers everything clearly. He says it feels like it happened yesterday.

After the water went away, it came back. The sea went back to normal for a short time. Then, the water started to move in circles. The sand on the bottom moved around. A pier near the hotel started to float away.

Some water came onto the road. It was not very high. It was only about 20 centimeters. Joe thought they would only get a little wet.

Then, a car was pushed towards the hotel by the water. Joe knew it was dangerous. He started to run. He held Paul's hand. He tried to keep Paul safe by holding him against a wall inside the hotel.

A big wave hit them. The water was up to their waists. It pushed them over a wall. The water tore Joe's clothes off.",0.7703886032104492,0.5,93.30172715053767,0.9174568212365581,0.908254317876344,0.7262143070289312,0.7624688148498535,0.6666666666666666,92.22738497109829,0.7,0.8322738497109828,0.7538031104091676,0.795067548751831,0.8,87.94045364472755,0.7,0.7894045364472755,0.7948240283997022
"Cars and tables slammed into the building as everything in the path of the 800km/h wave was lifted and flung high. Something hit Giardina on the back of the head and he went under, losing hold of Paul. Giardina found himself pushed horizontally against the outer corner of the hotel when a large object – a car, a fridge, he’ll never know – pinned his left arm to the wall. “I’m trying with my right hand to get out, get around the corner, to push away whatever was holding me. And I just couldn’t get there. I was underwater and I held my breath for as long as I could. The last thing I recall is just opening my mouth and that was it. The lights went off.” Today, he still finds consolation in the thought that Paul, whose body was found in a makeshift morgue by Joe’s brothers-in-law three days later, might have experienced something similar. “I can only hope – and it’s terrible – but I can only hope that Paul went through the same experience,” he says. “There was no suffering.” The Giardinas had weighed up whether to visit Thailand or Bali for Paul’s first overseas trip. Paul had Down’s syndrome and, while physically high-functioning, was unable to care for himself. Phuket seemed a safer option two years after Bali’s terrorist attacks and the family – Paul’s sister, two years his senior, stayed in Australia – chose to celebrate Christmas at Patong’s Seaview hotel, where Paul played ball in the swimming pool and was photographed smiling with Santa. Joe and Evanna called their affectionate son the “love machine”. “Twice in his short life, he had open heart surgery. The second time, he’d had a valve replaced in his heart, and when he’s woken up from the surgery, what was his first comment? It wasn’t tears and crying and screaming, it was ‘What happened?’ There wouldn’t be too many of us behaving that way,” Joe Giardina says, laughing. Giardina was found inside the hotel, lying prone and headfirst down a flight of steps on the third storey.","The wave was very fast. It went 800 kilometers per hour. It picked up cars and tables. It threw them into the building.

Something hit Giardina on his head. He fell into the water. He lost Paul.

Giardina was pushed against the hotel. Something big held his arm. It was a car or a fridge. He does not know. It pressed his arm to the wall.

He tried to move with his right hand. He wanted to get away. He could not. He was under the water. He held his breath. Then he opened his mouth. He does not remember anything after that.

Paul died in the wave. Three days later, his body was found. Giardina hopes Paul did not suffer. He hopes Paul died quickly, like him.

The Giardina family wanted to go on a trip. They thought about Thailand or Bali. It was Paul's first trip to another country. Paul had Down's syndrome. He needed help to take care of himself.

They went to Phuket because it seemed safe. It was two years after the bad attacks in Bali. They stayed at the Seaview hotel. Paul played with a ball in the pool. He took a picture with Santa.

Joe and Evanna loved their son. They called him the ""love machine"".

Paul had two big operations on his heart. The second time, he had a new part in his heart. When he woke up, he asked ""What happened?"". He did not cry. Joe Giardina laughs when he remembers this.

Giardina was found inside the hotel. He was lying on the stairs. His head was at the bottom. He was on the third floor.","The very fast wave was like a strong wind. It was going 800 kilometers per hour. It picked up cars and tables. It threw them into the building.

Something hit Giardina on his head. He fell down and lost his grip on Paul.

Giardina was pushed against the hotel wall. A big thing pinned his arm. It could have been a car or a fridge. He did not know.

He tried to move away with his other hand. He could not. He was underwater. He held his breath.

He opened his mouth. Then he lost consciousness. Everything went dark.

Later, Paul's body was found. Joe's family found him after three days.

Giardina hopes Paul did not suffer. He hopes Paul had a similar experience. He thinks there was no pain for Paul.

The Giardinas wanted to take Paul on a trip. They thought about Thailand or Bali. Paul had Down's syndrome. He needed help to take care of himself.

They chose Phuket because it seemed safer. It was two years after the Bali attacks.

The family stayed at the Seaview hotel. Paul played with a ball in the pool. He took a picture with Santa. His sister stayed in Australia.

Joe and Evanna loved their son very much. They called him the ""love machine.""

Paul had two heart surgeries. After the second surgery, he woke up. He did not cry. He asked, ""What happened?"" Joe Giardina laughed when he remembered this.

Paul's body was found three days later. It was in a temporary place for dead people. Giardina hopes Paul did not suffer. He hopes Paul's experience was similar to his own. He hopes Paul did not feel pain.

The Giardina family wanted to take Paul on a trip. They thought about Thailand or Bali. Paul had Down's syndrome. He needed help taking care of himself.

Paul had heart surgery twice. The second time, they fixed a part of his heart. When he woke up, he asked, ""What happened?"" He did not cry or scream. His father thinks that was very brave.

"His position saved his life: water drained out of his body. Initially deemed unlikely to survive, he was eventually taken to Bangkok hospital in Phuket, where the pain from his extensive injuries was numbed by the fear that he had lost Paul and Evanna. His wife was found unhurt and later reunited with him – she had ridden the wave to the hotel, grabbed hold of a balcony and miraculously avoided being sucked back out to sea. When Giardina was medevaced to Melbourne, the doctors’ first job was to flush the sand out of his lungs. “The one thing that it has taught me is how quickly it can all come to an end. You appreciate every day when you go through something like that,” he says, describing the speed at which the morning went from one of tropical calm to earth-shattering calamity. He and Evanna are grateful to have found Paul’s body among Thailand’s 5,400 victims, “because if we hadn’t, I know that there would be a sense of ‘He could be out there still’. And where do you start? We would have been walking the streets looking for him. And that would have been …” He pauses. “How do you cope with that?” It’s not accidental that when visitors to the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial take in the wave-shaped sculpture on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, they are also facing the water. Giardina instigated the memorial and requested that its aspect include water. Its unveiling in December 2015 was the first time Joe and Evanna had met all 25 of the other Australian victims’ families, after a 10-year process involving three governments. It’s given them a place where they can remember Paul, and this 26 December they plan to be there again, with their son in spirit. But part of Paul will always remain in Phuket. Joe and Evanna returned to Patong in October 2005 and again on the first anniversary of the disaster, and Joe has visited Thailand many times since, partly so that the tsunami does not dictate how he lives. “It’s part of the healing. I feel like part of Paul is there. If I didn’t go back, the tsunami would win.","He was in a good position. This saved his life. The water went out of his body. At first, people thought he would die. But he went to a hospital in Phuket, Thailand. It was called Bangkok hospital. He was hurt very badly. He was also afraid. He thought he had lost Paul and Evanna.

His wife, Evanna, was okay. She was not hurt. She found him later. The wave took her to the hotel. She held on to a balcony. She was lucky. She did not go back into the sea.

Joe was taken to Melbourne in a special airplane. Doctors cleaned the sand out of his lungs. Joe said he learned something important. Life can end very fast. He is thankful for every day. The morning was peaceful. Then, a big disaster happened very quickly.

Joe and Evanna are thankful they found Paul's body. He was one of 5,400 people who died in Thailand. If they did not find him, they would think he was still alive. They would look for him. It would be very hard for them. He does not know how he would deal with that.

There is a special place to remember the tsunami victims. It is in Canberra. It is a sculpture that looks like a wave. It is by the water. Joe helped make this memorial. He wanted it to be by the water.

The memorial opened in December 2015. Joe and Evanna met other families there. These families lost loved ones in the tsunami. It took 10 years to make the memorial. Three governments helped. The memorial is a place to remember Paul. They will go there again on December 26. They will remember Paul.

Part of Paul will always be in Phuket. Joe and Evanna went back to Phuket in October 2005. They also went back one year after the tsunami. Joe has gone back to Thailand many times. He does not want the tsunami to control his life.

Going back helps him feel better. He feels like Paul is still there. If he did not go back, the tsunami would win.","He was in a certain place, and this helped him stay alive. The water went out of his body. At first, people did not think he would live. But he went to a hospital in Phuket, Thailand. The hospital was in Bangkok. He was in a lot of pain because he had many injuries. But he was also worried about Paul and Evanna. He thought they might be dead.

His wife, Evanna, was okay. She was not hurt. She was with him again later. She was on the wave, but she got to the hotel. She held onto a balcony. She was lucky and did not go back into the sea.

Joe was taken to Melbourne by plane to get medical help. Doctors cleaned the sand out of his lungs. Joe said that this event showed him how fast things can change. He said he is thankful for every day because of what happened. That morning, it was calm and nice. Then, very quickly, everything became terrible.

Joe and Evanna are happy that they found Paul's body. Many people died in Thailand, about 5,400. They are happy they found Paul because if they had not, they would think he might still be alive. They would not know where to look for him. They would be looking for him on the streets. Joe said it would be very hard to deal with that.

There is a special place in Canberra to remember the tsunami. It is called the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial. It has a statue that looks like a wave. The statue faces the water. Joe made this memorial happen. He wanted it to face the water.

The memorial opened in December 2015. It was the first time Joe and Evanna met the families of the other Australians who died. There were 25 other families. It took 10 years to build the memorial. Three different groups of people in the government helped.

The memorial is a place where they can remember Paul. They will go there on December 26th. They will remember Paul.

But part of Paul will always be in Phuket. Joe and Evanna went back to Patong in October 2005. They also went back on the first year that they remember the tsunami. Joe has gone to Thailand many times since then. He goes so the tsunami does not control his life. He says it helps him feel better. He feels like part of Paul is there. If he did not go back, the tsunami would win.","He was lucky because of how he was lying. Water went out of his body. At first, people thought he would die. But he was taken to a hospital in Bangkok, in Phuket. He was in a lot of pain from his injuries. But he was more worried about Paul and Evanna. He thought he might have lost them.

His wife was okay. She was not hurt. She found him later. She was on the wave and it took her to the hotel. She held onto a balcony. It was a miracle she did not get pulled back into the sea.

Giardina was flown to Melbourne for more help. The doctors had to clean the sand out of his lungs. He said that this event showed him how fast life can change. He said you should be thankful for every day after something like this. He talked about how the morning went from peaceful to terrible so quickly.

He and Evanna are thankful they found Paul's body. Many people died in Thailand, about 5,400. They are glad they found Paul. If they had not, they would always wonder if he was still alive. They would not know where to look for him. This would be very hard. He stopped talking for a moment. He said, ""How do you deal with that?""

There is a special place to remember the tsunami. It is by a lake in Canberra. It has a statue that looks like a wave. When people look at the statue, they also see the water. Giardina helped to make this memorial. He wanted it to include water.

The memorial was opened in December 2015. It was the first time Joe and Evanna met the families of other Australians who died. There were 25 families. It took 10 years to build the memorial. Three different governments helped.

"The United Nations chief has denounced the “escalation” in hostilities between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Israel, calling IDF strikes on targets including at the airport in Sana’a “especially alarming” after it came under attack while the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane.

A spokesperson for UN secretary general, António Guterres, said in a statement: “The secretary general condemns the escalation between Yemen and Israel. Israeli airstrikes today on Sana’a international airport, the Red Sea ports and power stations in Yemen are especially alarming … “Today’s airstrikes follow around a year of escalatory actions by the Houthis in the Red Sea and the region that threaten civilians, regional stability and freedom of maritime navigation.” The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a social media post on Thursday that he was about to board a plane at the airport when it came under aerial attack. A crew member on the plane was injured, he said, and at least two people were reported killed at the airport. “The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged.

More than a year of Houthi attacks has disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys that have in turn stoked fears over global inflation. The UN security council is due to meet on Monday over the Houthi attacks on Israel, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel’s military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people.

"Paul Volcker, who has died aged 92, was the most eminent financial statesman of his generation, the sworn enemy of the abuse of finance in any of its manifestations. That could be indulging inflation as the financial outcome of governments and society living beyond their means, or investment banks deluding themselves they had uncovered the alchemy of risk-free lending through the issuance of ever more complex financial derivatives. His twin mantras were that finance should be the servant not the master of economy and society. And that good government is an indispensable component of a good society, in particular keeping the temptations of clever-clever finance at bay. Sound money and good government went hand in hand. He practised what he preached, seizing the opportunity to embody his beliefs when the moment arrived. Standing over 6ft 7in, and a lover of over-sized cigars and fly-fishing, he represented the best of New England liberalism – genial, good humoured and steely. From August 1979 to August 1987 he was chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the US’s central bank, appointed by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and and reappointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. In the early part of that period he crushed inflation out of the US economy. Just 18 months after he was appointed he had the courage to raise interest rates to 20% – a rate never seen before – prompting mass protests as the US economy plunged into recession. But he held firm and succeeded, inflation peaking at 14.8% before falling back to 3% by 1983. The foundations had been laid for sustained economic recovery and in the process warranting the principle that central bank independence is a crucial precondition for robust monetary policy. It was one of the defining moments in US monetary policy history, winning him plaudits not only for his resilience in the face of near universal criticism but also from the small but fast growing influential band of free market, “monetarist” economists who believed that control of the money supply using high interest rates was the sole means to curb inflation – not any kind of government interference into the market processes for setting wages and prices. Volcker temporarily was their hero. But they misjudged the man.","Paul Volcker has died. He was 92 years old. He was a very important person in finance. He did not like it when finance was used in the wrong way.

He did not like when governments spent too much money. This made prices go up (inflation). He also did not like banks that thought they could lend money without any risk. They did this with complex financial products.

Paul Volcker believed that finance should help the economy and people. He also thought that good government was very important. Good government should stop people from using finance in bad ways. He believed that good money and good government should work together.

He did what he believed. He was a tall man. He liked big cigars and fishing. He was a good man from New England. He was friendly, funny, and strong.

From 1979 to 1987, he was in charge of the US Federal Reserve. This is the central bank of the US. President Jimmy Carter and President Ronald Reagan chose him for this job.

At that time, prices were going up a lot in the US. Paul Volcker stopped this. He raised interest rates to 20%. This was very high. Many people protested. The US economy became worse.

But Paul Volcker did not change his mind. He was strong. Prices stopped going up so much. They went down to 3% in 1983. This helped the economy get better.

It also showed that central banks should be independent. This means they should make their own decisions about money. This is important for good money policy.

This was a very important time for money policy in the US. Many people praised Paul Volcker. He was strong even when people criticized him. Some economists liked how he controlled the money supply with high interest rates. They thought this was the only way to stop prices from rising. They thought the government should not interfere with prices and wages. Paul Volcker was their hero for a short time. But they did not understand him very well.","Paul Volcker died. He was 92 years old. He was a very important person in the world of money. He did not like it when money was used in the wrong way.

He thought it was wrong when governments spent too much money. This can cause prices to go up, which is called inflation. He also did not like it when banks tried to make money by taking big risks.

He believed that money should help people and the economy. Money should not be in control. He also thought that good government was important. A good government should stop people from being too clever with money. He believed that good money and good government should work together.

At that time, prices were going up very fast in the US. It was a big problem. Volcker stopped this inflation.

He raised interest rates very high. This made it more expensive to borrow money. Some people did not like this. The economy got worse for a short time.

But Volcker did not change his mind. He kept the interest rates high. Finally, the prices stopped going up so fast. Inflation went down from almost 15% to 3%.

This helped the economy to get better. It also showed that central banks need to be independent. This means they should not be controlled by the government. This is important for making good decisions about money.

It was a very important time for money in the US. People praised Volcker for being strong. Some economists also liked him.

But they were wrong about him.","Paul Volcker has died. He was 92 years old. He was a very important person in the world of money. He did not like it when people used money in the wrong way.

He thought that governments and people should not spend more money than they have. He also thought that banks should not trick themselves into thinking they can lend money without any risk. They did this by creating complicated financial products.

Volcker believed two important things. First, money should help the economy and people, not control them. Second, good government is needed for a good society. The government should stop people from misusing money. He believed that good money management and good government work together.

He showed what he believed by his actions. He was a tall man, over 6 feet 7 inches. He liked big cigars and fishing. He was a kind and strong person.

From 1979 to 1987, he was in charge of the US Federal Reserve. This is the central bank of the United States. President Jimmy Carter chose him, and President Ronald Reagan chose him again.

Only one and a half years after he started, he made a brave decision. He raised interest rates to 20%. This was very high, and people protested. The US economy got worse for a while.

But Volcker did not change his mind. He kept the interest rates high. Finally, inflation went down. It had been almost 15%, but it went down to 3% by 1983.

"Volcker never bought the proposition that the market was magical or that there could be a systematic relationship between the growth of the money supply and inflation. Rather he was intuitively suspicious of the short term and predatory instincts of most financial market participants, which lead to volatile and unpredictable market movements, and intuitively suspicious of the mania for dismantling the New Deal rules and regulations that restrained their worst types of behaviours that “free market“ economists said were inhibiting the efficiency of the US financial system. His willingness to be austere in raising interest rates so high was because he knew dear money worked reliably in squeezing inflation – not because he was an advocate of a hyper-free-market economy. He would be equally austere in resisting the siren calls to deregulate finance in the name of freeing up the market. It would come to no good. Nor did it. Volcker was a critic of successive rounds of financial deregulation after he left office, saying that the only useful financial innovation he had encountered was the invention of the ATM – cash dispensing machines. Even before the 2008-09 financial crisis he was warning that the invention of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps were inherently unstable, in effect transferring risk to the Federal Reserve, which would be compelled to underwrite the financial system if the markets ever lost confidence in them. So it proved as the financial crisis broke for precisely the reasons about which he had warned – unlike his successor Alan Greenspan, who had enthusiastically and uncritically embraced financial deregulation. President Obama appointed him head of the president’s economic advisory board in 2009 in the midst of the crisis. There he argued that the emergence of banks that were too big to fail, so forcing central bank rescues, was morally and economically insupportable and they should be broken up. If that was politically impossible then at least commercial banks who took deposits from the ordinary public should be banned from trading in high-risk financial derivatives on their own account – the so-called Volcker rule. Obama adopted the proposal and it became section 619 of the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act; banks cannot own, invest in or sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds or other trading operations for their own use.","Paul Volcker did not think the market was magic. He did not think money growth and inflation were always connected.

He did not trust the short-term plans of many people in the market. He thought they could make the market change a lot and be hard to predict.

Volcker did not like getting rid of old rules. These rules stopped bad behavior in the market. Some economists said these rules made the market less efficient.

Volcker was ready to raise interest rates very high. He knew this would lower inflation. He did this because it worked. He was not trying to make the market completely free.

He also did not want to remove rules from the financial market. He thought it would cause problems. And it did cause problems.

After he left his job, Volcker said that many new financial rules were bad. He said the only good new thing was the ATM. ATMs are machines that give you money.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, he said some new things were dangerous. These things were mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. He said they could make the Federal Reserve take on too much risk. He thought the market would lose trust in them.

He was right. The financial crisis happened because of these things. He had warned about them. Alan Greenspan, who came after Volcker, liked the new financial rules.

In 2009, President Obama asked Volcker to lead an economic group. This was during the financial crisis.

Volcker said some banks were too big. If they failed, the government had to help them. He thought this was wrong. He said these banks should be made smaller.

If this was not possible, he said banks should not be allowed to trade in risky things. These banks take money from normal people. This idea was called the Volcker Rule.

Obama liked this idea. It became part of a law in 2010. The law said banks cannot own or invest in certain risky funds for their own profit.","Paul Volcker did not think the market was perfect. He did not think that more money always meant more inflation. He did not trust people in the financial market. He thought they were often greedy and made the market go up and down quickly.

Volcker did not like the idea of getting rid of rules from the New Deal. These rules controlled bad actions in the market. Some economists thought these rules stopped the market from working well.

Volcker raised interest rates very high. He knew this would stop inflation. He did not want a completely free market. He also did not want to remove rules about money. He thought it was a bad idea. And he was right.

After Volcker left his job, he said that getting rid of financial rules was bad. He said the only good new thing in finance was the ATM.

Before 2008, Volcker warned about new types of investments. These were things like mortgage-backed securities. He said they were not safe. He thought they gave risk to the Federal Reserve bank. The Federal Reserve would have to help if people lost trust in these investments.

This happened in the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis happened because of the things Volcker had warned about. Alan Greenspan, who came after Volcker, had liked the idea of getting rid of financial rules.

In 2009, President Obama asked Volcker to help with the crisis. Volcker said that some banks were too big. If they failed, the government would have to save them. He said this was not fair. He thought these banks should be made smaller.

If that was not possible, Volcker said that banks should not be allowed to trade risky things. These banks took money from normal people. This idea was called the ""Volcker rule"".

Obama liked this idea. It became a rule in 2010. Now, banks cannot own or invest in some risky funds for their own profit.","Paul Volcker did not believe the market was perfect. He did not think the amount of money and inflation were always linked.

He did not trust the short-term goals of people in the market. He thought they could cause the market to change quickly and unexpectedly.

Volcker did not like getting rid of rules from the New Deal. These rules stopped bad behavior in the market. Some economists said these rules stopped the US financial system from working well.

Volcker raised interest rates very high. He did this because he knew it would stop inflation. It was not because he wanted a completely free market.

Before the 2008 financial crisis, he warned about mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. He thought they were dangerous. He said they moved risk to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve would have to support the financial system if people lost trust in these things.

This happened during the financial crisis. It was just as he had warned. Alan Greenspan, who came after Volcker, liked the removal of financial rules. He did not see the problems.

In 2009, President Obama made Volcker head of his economic advisory board. This was during the crisis.

"Volcker had once again made an indelible mark on the US financial system, and influenced British thinking in the legal obligation to ringfence commercial and investment bank operations. Born in Cape May, on the southern tip of New Jersey, Paul Jr was the son of Paul Volcker, a civil engineer, and his wife, Alma (nee Klippel); his grandparents were all German immigrants. He grew up in the conventional world of 1930s and 40s America – going to high school, attending the local Lutheran church, but already showing an interest in public affairs and a precocious intelligence . He gained a degree in history, economics and political science at Princeton University (1949), and went on to do a master’s in political economy and government at Harvard, and to study at the London school of Economics. In 1952 he joined the New York Federal Reserve as an economist. A career alternating between Wall Street and the US Treasury in ever more responsible jobs then followed before fatefully he caught the eye of President Carter in 1979. He was a convinced believer in international collaboration, helping to fashion the Plaza accords in 1986 when Germany and Japan agreed to allow their currencies to appreciate, so limiting their trade imbalances with the US. This vital adjustment, he knew, would not come from market forces spontaneously but from intergovernmental collaboration. He was a founder of the Trilateral Commission, to foster relations between Japan, western Europe and north America, and regular attender at the Bilderberg meetings of leaders and experts from Europe and north America, believing that the key international players had to understand each other better. Towards the end of his life this believer in the power, capacity and importance of good government became increasingly concerned about the collapse of trust in government, founding the Volcker Alliance to advance the understanding of – and education for – careers in public service. In 1954 he married Barbara Bahnson; she died in 1998.

"High street sales slumped in November in the weakest period for consumer spending for more than a year, as shoppers reined in their spending in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales across Britain fell by 0.6% when compared with the previous month, with only household goods stores reporting growth. In a sign of the stress facing retailers, the quantity of goods bought dropped by 0.4% in the three months to November compared with the previous three months, the first decline since April 2018. Annual growth in sales also slowed to 1%, mainly because of a slump in spending in non-food stores. The latest figures from the high street and online suggest heavy discounting around Black Friday failed to tempt consumers to part with their cash in one of the worst periods for retailers in recent decades. Analysts said unsettled weather, political and economic uncertainty over Brexit and the snap election, and consumers leaving their shopping to the last minute in hope of bigger discounts, all had an impact last month. High street retailers are also struggling with rising wage bills and the cost of business rates, as well as tough competition as consumers switch to online shopping. Recognising the difficulties on the high street, the government said it was committed to a “fundamental review” of business rates and announced new measures to help independent retailers in the Queen’s speech on Thursday. The measures include a 50% discount on business rates for small to medium-sized high street properties including shops, pubs and restaurants with a rateable value of less than £51,000, up from a 33% discount at present. The discount is also being extended to cinemas and music venues. The plans are unlikely to do much to help troubled major retailers such as House of Fraser or Debenhams as retail chains are not eligible for the discount and neither are large department stores. November was the fourth month in a row without growth in retail spending – the longest stretch since the mid-90s. The ONS said Black Friday was not included in the figures, as the US-inspired day of shopping discounts fell late in the month, on 29 November. It said its seasonally adjusted estimates accounted for this shift in timing. However, analysts said the timing of Black Friday could have had an impact and probably distorted November’s spending figures. The ONS said Black Friday spending patterns would probably influence its December release, with only early promotions captured in the November estimates.","Shops on the street sold less in November. It was the worst time for shops in more than one year. People did not buy as much before Christmas.

The Office for National Statistics said sales in Britain went down. They went down by 0.6% from last month. Only shops with things for the house sold more.

Shops are having problems. People bought 0.4% less things in the last three months. This is the first time sales went down since April 2018.

Sales grew slower this year. They grew by only 1%. This is because people did not buy things from non-food shops.

Shops on the street and online had big sales for Black Friday. But people still did not buy much. This was one of the worst times for shops in many years.

Experts said the weather was bad. They said people were not sure about Brexit and the election. People waited to buy things to get better sales. All these things made sales bad last month.

Shops on the street have to pay more money to workers. They also have to pay business rates. It is hard for them because people buy things online.

The government knows shops on the street have problems. They said they will look at business rates again. They will help small shops. The Queen said this on Thursday.

Small shops will pay 50% less business rates. This includes shops, pubs, and restaurants. They must be worth less than £51,000. Before, they paid 33% less. Cinemas and music places will also pay less.

These plans will not help big shops like House of Fraser or Debenhams. Big shops cannot pay less business rates. Big shops are having problems.

November was the fourth month in a row that shops sold less. This is the longest time since the 1990s.

The Office for National Statistics said Black Friday is not in these numbers. Black Friday was at the end of November, on the 29th. They changed the numbers to show this.

But experts said Black Friday might have made a difference. It might have changed the numbers for November.

The Office for National Statistics said Black Friday will change the numbers for December. The numbers for November only show sales before Black Friday.","Shops on the high street sold less in November. This was the worst time for shopping in over a year.

The Office for National Statistics said that shop sales in Britain went down by 0.6%. This is when compared to the month before. Only shops selling things for the house sold more.

Shops are having problems. People bought 0.4% fewer things in the three months before November. This is compared to the three months before that. This is the first time sales have gone down since April 2018.

The sales went up only 1% compared to last year. This is because people did not buy many things from non-food shops.

Shops in the high street and online had big sales for Black Friday. But people did not want to spend their money. It was a very bad time for shops.

Experts said that the weather was bad. Also, people were not sure about Brexit and the election. People waited to buy things, hoping for better sales. All these things made a difference last month.

Shops on the high street also have to pay more money to workers. The cost of business rates is also high. It is hard for them because more people are shopping online.

The government knows that shops on the high street are having problems. They said they will look at the business rates again. They also said they will help small shops. This was in the Queen's speech.

Small shops, pubs, and restaurants will pay 50% less in business rates. This is for shops that are not too big. Now, they pay 33% less. Cinemas and music places will also pay less.

But this will not help big shops like House of Fraser or Debenhams. Big shops cannot get this discount.

November was the fourth month in a row that shop sales did not go up. This is the longest time since the 90s.

Shops are having problems. The amount of things people bought went down by 0.4%. This was from August to November. It is the first time this has happened since April 2018.

The amount of sales also grew slower. It only grew by 1%. This is because people did not buy as much from shops that sell things other than food.

The shops and websites had big sales for Black Friday. But people still did not spend much money. This was one of the worst times for shops in many years.

Experts say that bad weather made things worse. Also, people were not sure what would happen with Brexit and the election. People also waited to shop until the last minute to get better deals. These things all made sales go down in November.

Shops are also having problems with paying their workers more. They also have to pay high business rates. It is also hard for shops to compete with online shopping.

The government knows that shops are having problems. They said they will look at the business rates. They also said they will help small shops. This was said in the Queen’s speech.

The government will give small shops a discount of 50% on their business rates. This is for shops, pubs, and restaurants that are not very big. Right now, the discount is 33%. Cinemas and music places will also get this discount.

But this might not help big shops that are having problems. Shops like House of Fraser and Debenhams are too big to get the discount.

"Duncan Brewer, a retail partner at the consultancy Oliver Wyman, said political uncertainty had lifted since the election and unemployment remained low, in a positive signal for consumer spending. However, he warned that at least two high street shopping chains were likely to go bust next year and about 100,000 jobs were likely to be cut across the sector. He said: “The slump in retail sales over November goes to show that despite the momentous shopping holiday of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, discounting periods are not an effective way of getting people into the shops.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

Duncan Brewer works for a company called Oliver Wyman. He helps shops. He said the election is over. This is good. Not many people are without a job. This is also good for shopping. People will spend money.

But Duncan also said something bad. At least two big shops will close next year. About 100,000 people who work in shops will lose their jobs. That is a lot of people.

He said that shops had low sales in November. November has special shopping days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Shops sell things for less money then. But Duncan said that selling things for less does not help shops. It does not make people go to the shops.","Okay, here's the rewritten text at a CEFR B1 level:

Duncan Brewer works for a company called Oliver Wyman. He helps shops. He said things are better now because the election is finished. Also, not many people are out of work. This is good for shops because people can spend money.

But Duncan said something bad might happen. He thinks that two big shops will close next year. This means that about 100,000 people who work in shops might lose their jobs.

Duncan also talked about sales. He said that shops had bad sales in November. This is even though there was Black Friday and Cyber Monday. These are days when shops sell things for less money. Duncan thinks that selling things for less does not help shops get more customers.","Okay, here's the rewritten text, aiming for CEFR B2 level:

"No one has dug into the vaults of the Bank of England and pilfered a gold bar, but security breaches for a central bank in the 21st-century age of information do not come much worse than this. Hedge funds have managed to gain access to an audio feed of the governor’s press conferences, thereby securing for themselves an advantage of a few seconds over viewers of the slightly delayed TV broadcast. In modern frantic markets, seconds can matter. The misuse of the audio feed by an unnamed third-party supplier is “wholly unacceptable”, said the Bank after the report by the Times. The governor, Mark Carney, will be squirming with embarrassment. He arrived in 2013 on a mission to modernise the Bank’s operations and information security was top of the list. Now Threadneedle Street stands accused of gross naivety. The audio feed was designed as a back-up in case the TV system failed, but the potential for mischief should have been obvious. The Bank left a back door, if not wide open, then significantly ajar. The call for somebody’s resignation will be loud. No hedge fund or trader, it should be said, had advance knowledge of the Bank’s actual policy decisions, which are the main event on these stage-managed occasions. Interest rate decisions, for example, are announced to the world on the stroke of midday, and the full set of accompanying documents is published simultaneously. Journalists are allowed to read the contents in advance only if they are locked in the bowels of the Bank until midday in a secure room with no wifi or mobile phone signal. The security breach concerns only the press conferences, which start at 12.30pm. A consolation for the Bank, one could argue, is that Carney’s press conferences tend to be spectacularly dull. He’s in the business of explaining reports that are in the public domain by the time he speaks and he tends not to stray far from his mental script. For ordinary mortals, a five-second informational advantage might be useless. Even five minutes to wade through Carney’s sub-clauses might not yield nuggets to indicate if the pound should be moving up, down or sideways.","It is hard to steal gold from the Bank of England. But something bad happened with security. It is about information in the 21st century.

Some companies got a secret audio of the governor speaking. The governor is the boss of the bank. He talks to the news on TV. But these companies heard him a few seconds earlier.

In today's fast markets, a few seconds can make a difference. The audio was given by another company. The Bank said this was very bad.

The newspaper, the Times, wrote about it. The governor, Mark Carney, will be upset. He came to the bank in 2013. He wanted to make the bank more modern. He also wanted better security.

Now, people think the bank was not careful. The audio was a backup. It was for if the TV did not work. But the bank should have known someone could use it for bad things. The bank left a door open.

Many people will want someone to leave their job. But the companies did not know the bank's plans early. The bank makes important decisions. For example, about interest rates.

The bank tells the world about these decisions at 12 o'clock. They also give out documents. Journalists can read them early. But they must stay in a room. The room has no internet or phones. They stay there until 12 o'clock.

This problem is only about the press conferences. These start at 12:30. The governor's talks are often boring. He explains reports that people can already read. He does not say much new.

For normal people, five seconds is not useful. Even five minutes to read what the governor says may not help. It may not tell you if the money will go up or down.","It is very hard to steal gold from the Bank of England. But something bad happened with the Bank's security. This happened in the 21st century, when information is very important.

Some hedge funds got secret access. They could listen to the audio of the governor's speeches before everyone else. The governor is the head of the Bank. The hedge funds could hear the audio a few seconds before people watching TV.

In today's markets, even a few seconds can be important. This gave the hedge funds an advantage. The Bank of England said that this was ""not acceptable."" This happened because of a third-party company. This company should not have done this.

The governor, Mark Carney, will be upset. He started working at the Bank in 2013. He wanted to make the Bank modern. He also wanted to improve security. Now, people think the Bank was careless.

The audio was meant to be a backup. It was for if the TV system did not work. But it was easy for people to misuse it. The Bank did not protect the audio well enough. People will want someone to lose their job because of this.

The hedge funds did not know the Bank's plans before they were announced. The important decisions are still secret until they are made public. For example, interest rates are announced at 12:00. All the documents are released at the same time.

Journalists can read the documents early. But they must stay in a secure room at the Bank until 12:00. They cannot use Wi-Fi or their phones. The security problem was only with the press conferences, which start at 12:30.

The Bank can feel a little better because the governor's speeches are often boring. He talks about reports that people can already read. He usually says what he has planned.

For most people, a few seconds of information is not helpful. Even a few minutes to read the governor's words might not help them know if the British pound will go up or down.","It is very hard to steal gold from the Bank of England. But something bad happened with the Bank's security. This happened in the time of computers and information.

Some groups that manage money, called hedge funds, got secret access. They could listen to the Bank governor's talks before everyone else. They heard the talks a few seconds before people watching TV.

In today's fast markets, even a few seconds can be important. A company gave the hedge funds this secret audio feed. The Bank of England said this was ""not okay.""

The Bank governor, Mark Carney, may feel bad. He came to the Bank to make things better. He wanted to improve how the Bank keeps information safe. Now, people think the Bank was not careful enough.

The audio feed was meant to be a backup. It was for times when the TV system did not work. But the Bank should have known this could cause problems. The Bank left a small way for people to get secret information.

People may ask someone to leave their job because of this. It is important to know that the hedge funds did not know the Bank's plans ahead of time. The Bank makes important decisions at these talks. For example, they talk about interest rates.

These decisions are announced at 12:00. All the important papers are shared at the same time. Reporters can read these papers early. But they must stay in a safe room at the Bank. They cannot use phones or the internet until 12:00.

"The trouble is, there is a breed of hedge funds that does not operate like ordinary mortals do. They’re pursuing fast action and even the possibility of morsels of information count in their world. Some even run artificial intelligence computer programmes to alight on specific words or phrases and then trade instantly, and perhaps only for a brief second, on what they learn. This type of hedge fund may also be interested in what Carney doesn’t say, as much as what he does, in response to a question. Such strategies seek only marginal gains, and success is clearly not guaranteed, but a central bank simply cannot give anybody any theoretical opportunity to get ahead of the market. The fallout from this affair will be fascinating. The Financial Conduct Authority will have to decide if the third-party supplier (which surely won’t remain unidentified for long) has merely breached its contract with the Bank or has committed market abuse, which is a serious regulatory matter. The market abuse question also applies to the hedge funds, though the FCA will face an obvious difficulty in proving that a trade was placed because of access to the audio feed rather than something unrelated. This could be groundbreaking territory. The judgment on the Bank of England, by contrast, is already clear. It looks amateurish.","Some hedge funds are different. They do not work like normal people. They want to act very fast. Small pieces of news are important to them.

These hedge funds care about what someone does *not* say. They want to get small advantages. It is not sure they will win. But a bank cannot let anyone get ahead.

This situation will be interesting. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will look at it. They will see if the company that gave the audio broke a rule. Did they only break a contract with the bank? Or did they do something worse called ""market abuse""? This is serious.

The FCA will also look at the hedge funds. Did they trade because of the audio? Or was it for another reason? It will be hard to prove. This is a new situation.

"Saturday was not so super for retailers last weekend, as numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres fell by nearly 8% compared with the previous year. With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and often hang on for last-minute bargains. More than a third (36%) of Brits have left gift-buying until the last few days before Christmas, according to Argos. It said 10% more men than women leave gift-buying until very late, with the most popular gift bought in its stores on Christmas Eve last year being an electric toothbrush. John Lewis expected novelty socks and gadgets such as airpods and smart speakers to be its most popular last-minute items. Monday was expected to be the busiest day for food retailers with Waitrose expecting to sell 214,000kg of sprouts in the final days before Christmas and 250% more quails eggs than usual. The lower turnout recorded by shopper monitoring firm Springboard on Saturday –traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year – came despite a flurry of discounts from retailers in an effort to tempt bargain hunters after a difficult trading year. Industry experts said the plethora of promotions on offer since November, and particularly over the Black Friday discount period at the end of November, meant many had spent their money early or were underwhelmed by further price cuts. Late last week Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to up to 60%, from 40% and 50% respectively earlier in the week, while Jigsaw, Peacocks and House of Fraser increased their price cuts to 50%, matching Debenhams, Hobbs and Oasis, which had deepened their discounts. Marks &amp; Spencer also added knitwear to its price-cutting pile, offering 40% off its key seasonal category, as well as a half-price on beauty gifts offer. The difficult trading is expected to bring further distress for retailers in early 2020 after numerous administrations and store closures this year. The number of retailers in financial distress in the final quarter of the year has risen 1.4% on the same period last year to 27,000, according to data from the corporate recovery firm Begbies Traynor. Fashion chains are among the worst affected, with the number in distress increasing by 21% in the past three years to 3,355.","Last Saturday was not a great day for shops.

Springboard watches how many people go to shops. They said fewer people went shopping on Saturday. Saturday is usually a very busy shopping day. Shops offered many discounts to try to get people to buy things. They wanted to attract people after a hard year for sales.

Experts said that shops had many sales since November. Black Friday was at the end of November. Because of these sales, people had already spent their money. Or they were not interested in more sales.

Last week, some shops had bigger discounts. Topshop and Miss Selfridge had discounts of up to 60%. Before, they were 40% and 50%. Other shops like Jigsaw, Peacocks, and House of Fraser also had bigger discounts. They offered 50% off, like Debenhams, Hobbs, and Oasis.

Marks & Spencer also had sales. They offered 40% off knitwear. This is an important thing to sell at this time of year. They also had half-price beauty gifts.

"The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal. After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats. The sources said at least 20 of the Bank’s staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation’s payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources. The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth £651bn. According to the former employees, the Bank’s chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year. Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney’s departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale. Much of the disquiet stemmed from a move to dismantle the Bank’s “security and privacy” directorate, the people said. The team, part of the central services division, previously had oversight over cyber, personnel and physical security matters, as well as privacy. Staff and responsibilities were instead spread across other parts of the organisation.","The Bank of England changed its security team. Then, some important people left their jobs. These people helped to keep Britain's money systems safe.

Before this, the Bank of England had a problem. Some companies got secret information early. This information was from press meetings.

After this problem, some people who used to work at the Bank talked to a newspaper called ""The Observer."" They said the Bank was having trouble. Key people who protected the Bank from danger were leaving.

These people said that at least 20 security staff had left or moved to other jobs in the last year. This makes people ask: Are Britain's money systems safe? Are other important things safe?

The people who used to work at the Bank said that the top security person and two other security leaders have left.

They said the Bank had less money to spend before Mark Carney left. They were worried about saving money.

They also said that there were not enough staff. People were not happy at work.

"It is understood that many of the people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directorates, in a move designed to make the organisation safer. The Bank has about 70 cybersecurity professionals. A Bank of England spokeswoman said: “The Bank operates the highest standard of information security and is confident in our ability to recognise cyber threats and defend our systems appropriately. Earlier this year, the Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model and, as part of that, reinforced the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.” The Bank admitted late on Wednesday night that it had suffered a security breach, with a provider of a backup audio feed of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences selling early access to unnamed investors without its knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit. It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating the issue, and it is understood that Bailey will recuse himself from all discussions of the matter to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest. The Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, is the most senior manager responsible for physical and information security, and faced calls to resign from a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, following the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor, and has an equal status to the Bank’s deputy governors. Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services division, which was managed by Place. They said the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in December 2018 that the Bank needed to deliver better value for money. Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him. A spokeswoman for the Bank said Rogers resigned on 23 February and that Place was not aware he was going to quit when she gave evidence on 21 January.","Many people work in the Bank of England.

"At the hearing, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, expressed surprise at Place’s answer, given the difficulties other public-sector organisations had with recruiting and retaining cyber security staff, and asked again if there were any vacancies. Place responded: “Offhand, I do not know whether we have any vacancies, but we do not have a problem with recruiting and we do not have a problem with retention in cyber, either.” There was widespread unease within the Bank following her testimony, multiple sources said, and in the months after her appearance the cybersecurity function suffered the outflow of staff. The public sector struggles to retain staff in cybersecurity roles because of intense competition from the higher-paying private sector. However, the reputation of the Bank and its important role in protecting financial stability are attractive for potential candidates, and the sources said they believed it was in the public interest to shed light on the problems it was facing. A Bank of England spokesperson said: “The incident relating to the misuse of a backup audio feed from the Bank’s press conferences by a third-party supplier, which the Bank has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority for further investigation, was not a cyber security issue.”","Here is the rewritten text, suitable for CEFR A2 level:

"UK high streets have shed more than 140,000 jobs this year as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most challenging years in a generation. More than 2,750 jobs were lost every week, according to a detailed analysis by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published today. It predicts the picture will worsen in 2020, unless the government intervenes, with high business rates one of the factors blamed for accelerating chain store closures. Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR’s director, said retail was in crisis owing to high costs, low levels of profitability and sales moving online. “These problems are felt by most businesses operating from physical stores in high streets or shopping malls,” Bamfield said. “The low growth in consumer spending since 2015 has meant that the growth in online sales has come at the expense of the high street.” The CRR said 38,100 of the jobs lost this year were down to retail chains going bust with Karen Millen and Coast among 2019’s high profile casualties. Another 26,500 roles were shed through company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a controversial insolvency procedure that has been used by the likes of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group and Debenhams to shed loss-making stores. Another 78,600 jobs were axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small shops simply shutting for good. Marks &amp; Spencer is among the big names closing stores while House of Fraser, which is part of Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, has also been shutting outlets. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, according to CRR’s calculations, up by more than a fifth on 2018’s 117,400. The CRR also calculated that 16,073 shops closed around the UK in 2019, or around 61 every working day. That was an increase on the 14,583 shops which closed in 2018. A separate study looking at how the UK labour market had changed over the past decade said the rise of online shopping had eliminated 289,000 “traditional” high street roles. Eight out of 10 of these entry-level retail jobs – positions like sales assistant and checkout operator – were held by women, according to the RSA Future Work Centre.","In the UK, many shops are in the high street. This year, many people lost their jobs in these shops. More than 140,000 people lost their jobs.

Shops are closing. Companies are failing. 2019 was a very hard year for shops.

A group called the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) looked at this. They said that every week, more than 2,750 jobs were lost.

The CRR thinks things will get worse in 2020. The government needs to help.

One problem is the cost of having a shop. This is making shops close faster.

Professor Joshua Bamfield works at the CRR. He said shops are in trouble. They have high costs and not much profit. People are buying things online instead of in shops.

He said many shops in high streets and shopping centres have these problems. People are not spending much money. So, online shops are doing well, but high street shops are not.

The CRR said that 38,100 jobs were lost because shops closed. For example, Karen Millen and Coast closed down.

Also, 26,500 jobs were lost because of something called CVAs. CVAs are a way for companies to close shops that lose money. Some big companies like Arcadia and Debenhams used CVAs.

Another 78,600 jobs were lost because big shops cut costs. Some small shops just closed down.

Marks & Spencer is a big shop that is closing some stores. House of Fraser is also closing shops.

The CRR said that 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019. This is more than in 2018. In 2018, 117,400 jobs were lost.

The CRR also said that 16,073 shops closed in the UK in 2019. That is about 61 shops every day. In 2018, 14,583 shops closed.

Another study looked at jobs in the UK. It said that online shopping has taken away 289,000 jobs in high street shops.

Many of these jobs were for women. These jobs were things like sales assistant and checkout operator. A group called the RSA Future Work Centre said that eight out of ten of these jobs were held by women.","Shops in the UK are losing many jobs.

This year, more than 140,000 people have lost their jobs because shops are closing. 2019 has been a very difficult year for shops.

A group called the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) looked at this problem. They found that about 2,750 jobs were lost each week.

The CRR thinks things will get worse in 2020. They say the government needs to help. One problem is that shops have to pay high business rates. This makes it hard for them to stay open.

Prof Joshua Bamfield is the director of the CRR. He said that shops are in trouble. They have to pay a lot of money, but they do not make much profit. Also, more people are shopping online.

Mr. Bamfield said that many shops in town centers and shopping malls are having problems. People are not spending much money in shops. Instead, they are buying things online. This hurts the shops.

The CRR said that 38,100 jobs were lost because some big shops closed down. Karen Millen and Coast were two of these shops.

Also, some companies used a special plan to close shops that were losing money. This plan is called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group and Debenhams used this plan. This caused another 26,500 people to lose their jobs.

Another 78,600 jobs were lost because shops cut costs. Some big shops closed stores. Other small shops closed down completely. Marks & Spencer is one big shop that is closing stores. House of Fraser is also closing stores.

In total, 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019. This is more than in 2018. In 2018, 117,400 jobs were lost.

The CRR also said that 16,073 shops closed in the UK in 2019. This is about 61 shops every working day. This is more than in 2018. In 2018, 14,583 shops closed.

Another study looked at how the job market in the UK has changed in the last 10 years. It said that online shopping has caused 289,000 ""traditional"" jobs in town centers to disappear.

These jobs include jobs like sales assistant and checkout operator. Most of these jobs were done by women. A group called the RSA Future Work Centre found that women held eight out of ten of these jobs.",0.7942669987678528,0.5,91.9222408026756,0.95194397993311,0.904805602006689,0.7330242002581806,0.7838199138641357,1.0,90.96045231213874,0.7,0.8196045231213873,0.867808145661841,0.7847254872322083,0.8,88.8618082208741,0.7,0.7986180822087409,0.7944478564803165
"The thinktank is part of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the charity run by Matthew Taylor who authored a gig economy review for Theresa May when she was prime minister. Alan Lockey, who heads the thinktank, said: “The carnage on the high street has hollowed out many jobs traditionally held by women, but areas of growth related to e-commerce, such as van driving, are going more to men. This is having a profound effect on individuals, families and society.” Today one in every five pounds spent at the shops is online – more than double the level at the start of the decade. The resulting shift in labour markets are stark. There are now 166,000 fewer check-out staff, shelf fillers and sales assistants than at the start of the 2010s, according to RSA’s analysis of official employment data, while the pool of bank and post office clerks has shrunk by 65,000 as branches closed. By comparison there are 102,000 more van drivers and 161,000 more administration roles. Lockey said the decline of the high street was the most dramatic factor affecting the UK’s jobs landscape, even though austerity, which had eliminated 109,000 public sector administrators, also loomed large. Despite the reckoning taking place the retail sector remains the UK’s biggest private sector employer with a workforce of around 3 million. Its decline contrasts with a wider picture showing record levels of employment as former shop workers find alternative work in restaurants, hotels and as care workers. The RSA study showed a near 78,000 rise in the number of care workers. “The employment figures show that over the last decade the economy has been good at creating jobs but low skilled workers in the retail sector have been pushed from pillar to post. The alternative jobs they are getting are often low paid and do not provide good security, leading to working poverty,” Lockey added. The important Christmas trading period appears to have brought little respite for struggling retail chains. Trading during November and December was marred by heavy discounting as stores sought to tempt out shoppers put off by the uncertainty around Brexit and the 12 December general election. The post-Christmas sales got off to a disappointing start too, attracting smaller crowds than in previous years.","Here is the rewritten text at an A2 CEFR level:

There is a group called a ""thinktank."" This group is part of a bigger group called the Royal Society. Matthew Taylor runs this bigger group. He wrote a report about the ""gig economy"" for Theresa May. She was the Prime Minister before.

Alan Lockey is in charge of the thinktank. He said that many shops are closing. This means that many jobs are disappearing. These jobs were often for women. But new jobs are appearing because of the internet. These new jobs, like driving vans, are often for men. This is bad for people, families, and the country.

Now, people buy more things online. They spend more money online than before. This changes the jobs that are available.

There are fewer people working as check-out staff in shops. There are also fewer people filling shelves in shops. And fewer people helping customers. There are 166,000 fewer of these jobs than before. Also, many banks and post offices have closed. So, there are 65,000 fewer bank and post office workers.

But there are more van drivers now. There are 102,000 more van drivers. And there are 161,000 more people working in offices.

Alan Lockey said that shops closing is a big problem for jobs in the UK. The government also cut some jobs. This affected 109,000 office workers who worked for the government.

Even though many shops are closing, shops still employ many people. About 3 million people work in shops. But now, many people who used to work in shops are finding other jobs. They are working in restaurants, hotels, or as care workers. There are almost 78,000 more care workers now.

Alan Lockey said that the economy has created new jobs. But people who used to work in shops are not getting good jobs. The new jobs often pay less. They are not safe and secure. So, people are working but still poor.

Christmas is usually a good time for shops. But this Christmas was not good. Shops had sales to try to get people to buy things. People were worried about Brexit and the election. So, they did not buy as much. The sales after Christmas were not very good either. Not many people went to the shops.","This group studies important things. It is part of a bigger group called the Royal Society. This group helps with arts, factories, and business. Matthew Taylor runs this group. He wrote a report about the gig economy for Theresa May when she was the leader of the country.

Alan Lockey is the boss of the study group. He said that many shops are closing. This means that women are losing jobs. But new jobs are being created because of online shopping. For example, there are more van drivers. But men are getting these jobs more often than women. This is bad for people, families, and the country.

Now, people spend more money online. They spend twice as much as they did ten years ago. This has changed the job market a lot.

There are fewer people working as check-out staff, shelf fillers, and sales assistants. There are 166,000 fewer of these jobs than ten years ago. Also, 65,000 fewer people work in banks and post offices because many branches have closed.

But there are more van drivers. There are 102,000 more van drivers now. Also, there are 161,000 more jobs in administration.

Alan Lockey said that shops closing is the biggest problem for jobs in the UK. The government also cut money, which caused 109,000 public sector jobs to be lost.

Even though many shops are closing, the retail business is still the biggest employer in the UK. About 3 million people work in retail.

Even though retail is doing badly, there are many jobs in the UK. People who used to work in shops are finding jobs in other places. They are working in restaurants, hotels, and as care workers. The study showed that there are almost 78,000 more care workers.

Alan Lockey said that the economy has made many jobs in the last ten years. But people with less skills who worked in shops are having trouble. The new jobs they are getting often do not pay well and are not secure. This means that they are working but still poor.

Shops hoped to make a lot of money during Christmas. But it was not a good time for them. They had to give big discounts to get people to shop. People were worried about Brexit and the election. The sales after Christmas were not very good either. Not many people came to the shops.","This group does research. It is part of a bigger organization called the Royal Society for the Arts.

"The embattled US aircraft maker Boeing has reportedly sent US regulators “troubling communications” related to the development of the 737 MAX – on the same day that the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was forced to step aside. According to a senior Boeing executive, the documents include new messages from Mark Forkner, a senior company test pilot who complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of Boeing’s MCAS anti-stall system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Seattle Times that the Forkner communications contain the same kind of “trash talking” about Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulators as the earlier messages released in October. The release is likely to deepen the sense of crisis enveloping Boeing, which has taken more than $8bn in costs and lost more than 20% of its market value since the 737 variant was grounded in March following two crashes. Last week, the company said it would temporarily halt production of the troubled jet. Forkner, meanwhile, has reportedly hired his own criminal defense lawyers and invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid turning over records to the US Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal inquiry into the company’s handling of the 737 Max’s development. It was Forkner who requested that information about MCAS be omitted from flight manuals and pilot training, rendering the pilots of both the doomed Lion Air and Ethiopian flights helpless when the system kicked in, pushing the plane’s nose down repeatedly until they ultimately lost control. But the timing of the latest information release is likely to increase anger surrounding Boeing’s handling of the crisis, even as a new CEO, David Calhoun, takes the reins early next year. In a statement released on Monday, Boeing said that under the “new leadership”, Boeing “will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers”. But the latest drop of documents could complicate those intentions, and further challenge its relationship with regulators.","Boeing is a company that makes planes in the US.

"The aerospace giant already angered the FAA by failing to turn over the Forkner messages for eight months because of the criminal investigation into how the plane was originally approved for service. “The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery,” the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also reportedly further vexed by Muilenburg’s predictions that the 737 Max would imminently be cleared to return to service, which it regarded as placing pressure on the agency to approve Boeing’s MCAS software fix even as it was taking a hit to its reputation for being too cozy with the plane maker. Last month, Muilenburg was reportedly called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, and dressed down for applying perceived pressure on the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg’s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job. During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker’s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia. “You’re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?” the Democrat Dina Titus challenged. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m. In a statement on Monday, Boeing’s board said it had decided that “a change in leadership” was necessary to restore confidence. But it chose not to fire the executive, allowing him to keep his pay package and saving Boeing from the impression its most senior executive had done something wrong.","Boeing is a big company that makes airplanes.

The failure to make the case for our EU membership goes back a long way, as does the drip-drip of the vile anti-European campaign in the Murdoch press, and the obvious suspects in other sections of the media. The sequence of events was well brought out in Denis MacShane’s prophetic book Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe in 2015. (What lies in store is outlined both in MacShane’s latest volume, Brexiternity, and Sir Ivan Rogers’s recent magisterial lecture at Glasgow University.) As MacShane wrote in 2015: “The referendum on Europe is not on the benefits or cost of EU membership, but a wider protest about economic and social change which appears inside Britain to produce as many losers as winners.” It was always easy to blame “Brussels” for policies that became controversial, even when those policies were initiated by successive UK governments themselves. One of the leading perpetrators of lies about Europe was, of course, the Telegraph’s former Brussels correspondent himself: Boris Johnson. Johnson is such a master of what his putative hero Winston Churchill called “terminological inexactitudes” that nothing he claimed during the campaign or the morning of his victory can be taken at face value. “One-nation Conservatism”? Governing for the interests of those northerners who have “lent him their votes”? Pull the other one! How does that compare with his plans for deregulation, closer alignment with Trump’s America, and the opportunities for profiting from Brexit to which his financial backers look forward? As Rogers said in his Glasgow lecture, Johnson’s claim that we will “not suffer any downside in terms of market access into easily our biggest market for goods and services … is clearly untrue. It does not get any truer through endless repetition.” The nation has been the victim of a gigantic con trick on the part of the Leave campaign.","It is an old saying: ""Be careful what you wish for."" I think: ""Be careful what you vote for.""

I have written a lot about staying in the EU. Now, it is a lost cause. I am sorry. The people who wanted Britain to stay in the EU did not lead well.

For a long time, they did not explain why being in the EU was good. Some newspapers and TV channels said bad things about the EU. This went on for a long time.

Denis MacShane wrote a book in 2015. It was called ""Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe."" He said what would happen. He was right.

MacShane wrote that the vote about Europe was not really about the EU. It was about people who felt they were losing because of changes in Britain.

It was easy to blame the EU for bad things. But sometimes, the British government made those rules.

Boris Johnson lied about Europe. He used to work for a newspaper in Brussels. He is good at saying things that are not true.

Johnson says he will help everyone in Britain. He says he will help people in the north who voted for him. But he also wants to change rules and be more like America. His rich friends want to make money from Brexit.

Ivan Rogers said that Johnson is wrong. Johnson says that Britain will still sell things easily to Europe. Rogers said this is not true. Saying it again and again does not make it true.

The people who voted to leave the EU were tricked. The Leave campaign lied to them.","It's like an old saying: ""Think carefully about what you want."" I also think we should be careful about who we vote for.

I have written a lot about why I wanted Britain to stay in the European Union. I am sorry that this did not happen.

The people who wanted Britain to stay in the EU did not do a good job. They did not explain why it was good for the country.

For a long time, some newspapers and other media have said bad things about the EU. They slowly made people think that the EU was bad.

Denis MacShane wrote a book in 2015 called ""Brexit."" It said how Britain would leave Europe. He also wrote another book called ""Brexiternity."" And Ivan Rogers gave a speech about it. These books and speeches tell us what might happen now.

MacShane wrote that the vote about Europe was not just about money. It was about people being unhappy with changes in the country. Some people felt like they were losing out.

It was easy to blame the EU for problems. But sometimes, the British government made those problems.

Boris Johnson used to work for a newspaper in Brussels. He often said things that were not true about Europe. He is very good at saying things that sound good, but are not really correct.

We cannot believe everything Johnson said during the campaign or after he won.

He says he wants to help everyone in the country. He says he wants to help people in the north who voted for him. But he also wants to make changes that will help rich people and make closer ties with America. His rich friends are happy about Brexit because they can make money from it.

Rogers said that Johnson is wrong when he says that Britain will not have any problems selling things to Europe after Brexit. Just saying it over and over does not make it true.

The people who wanted Britain to leave the EU tricked the country. They told people things that were not true.","The Chinese have a saying: ""Be careful what you wish for."" I have a similar saying: ""Be careful who you vote for.""

I wrote a lot about why Britain should stay in the EU. On Thursday, it seemed like we lost. The people who wanted Britain to stay in the EU did not lead very well.

For a long time, they did not explain why being in the EU was good. Also, some newspapers and other media wrote bad things about the EU.

Denis MacShane wrote a book in 2015. It was called ""Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe."" The book said what would happen if Britain left the EU. MacShane also wrote another book called ""Brexiternity."" Ivan Rogers also gave a speech about Brexit at Glasgow University. These books and speeches tell us what to expect.

MacShane wrote that the vote about the EU was not just about money. It was also about people being unhappy with changes in Britain. Some people felt they were losing because of these changes.

It was easy to blame the EU for things people did not like. But sometimes, the British government started those things.

Boris Johnson used to write about the EU for a newspaper. He told lies about the EU. He is good at saying things that are not completely true. So, you cannot believe everything he said during the campaign or after he won.

He says he wants to help everyone in Britain. He says he wants to help people in the north who voted for him. But that might not be true. He wants to change the rules. He wants to be closer to America. He wants his rich friends to make money from Brexit.

Rogers said that Johnson is wrong to say Britain will not lose anything by leaving the EU. He said that Britain will lose access to the EU market. The EU is where Britain sells most of its goods and services. Saying something over and over does not make it true.

The Leave campaign tricked the nation.

"The nonsensical propaganda about “getting Brexit done” was finally too much for the counsellor in the British embassy in Washington who resigned recently because she could no longer face peddling a misleading line. But back to failures of leadership: Jeremy Corbyn’s failure was on an epic scale. Reputedly a Leaver himself, he made a huge mistake in thinking that, by equivocating over the referendum, he could somehow please those supposedly natural Labour voters in the Midlands and the north who had voted Leave in the referendum. The election showed that too many of them merely laughed in his face. It seems that the election was also a referendum on Corbyn. There has been, and will continue to be, endless speculation about the reasons why the electorate distrusted him even more than Johnson. But historically there seems to me a simple, fundamental cause, whatever the deficiencies in Corbyn personally. In the early 1980s the sensible centre of the Labour party fought the extreme left – then known as the Militant Tendency, not Momentum – and saw them off. The late Denis Healey played a crucial role, as did Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. And the moderate left in Britain and continental Europe watched the failure of President Mitterrand’s experiment with “socialism in one country” between 1981 and 1983 and learned the lesson. Among those who learned the lesson was Mitterrand himself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also took note. Alas, this time the extreme left captured the Labour party, with the results we now see. For reasons that I fail to understand, Corbyn and his allies, such as Seumas Milne, believe that the EU is some kind of capitalist conspiracy. Despite the many doubts about Corbyn himself, if he had not equivocated and campaigned vigorously in favour of Remain and a referendum with no ifs or buts, there might well have been a hung parliament and deals which could have contained Corbyn’s wilder plans. Also, the hapless Jo Swinson should not have made the strategic mistake of ruling out the second referendum her party had previously espoused. However, we are where we are.","A woman worked at the British embassy in America. She helped tell people about Brexit. Brexit was when the UK left the European Union.

She thought the information about Brexit was not true. She did not want to tell people things that were not correct. So, she quit her job.

Now, let's talk about Jeremy Corbyn. He was a leader of the Labour party. He made a big mistake. Many people think he wanted the UK to leave the European Union.

He tried to please everyone about Brexit. He did not say clearly what he thought. People in some areas of England voted to leave the EU. Corbyn thought he could get their votes.

But many people did not trust him. They voted against him in the election. The election was also about whether people liked Corbyn.

Many people did not trust Corbyn more than they trusted Johnson. Johnson was another leader.

A long time ago, in the 1980s, there were different groups in the Labour party. One group was called the Militant Tendency. They had extreme ideas.

Other leaders in the Labour party stopped the Militant Tendency. These leaders were Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, and Roy Hattersley.

At the same time, France had a leader named President Mitterrand. He tried new ideas. But they did not work well.

Other leaders like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown learned from this. They saw that extreme ideas can fail.

But this time, the extreme left group took over the Labour party. Now we see the results. Corbyn and his friends thought the European Union was bad. They thought it was a plan by rich people.

Many people did not trust Corbyn. But if he had clearly supported staying in the EU, things might be different. There might have been no clear winner in the election. Then, Corbyn's ideas might not have been possible.

Also, another leader, Jo Swinson, made a mistake. She said there would not be another vote on Brexit. Her party had wanted another vote before.

But now, things are the way they are. We cannot change the past.","A woman worked at the British embassy in America. She had to tell people about Brexit. Brexit was a plan for Britain to leave the European Union.

The woman thought the things she had to say about Brexit were not true. She did not want to say things that were not true. So, she quit her job.

Someone named Jeremy Corbyn was a leader in Britain. He made big mistakes. Some people said he wanted Britain to leave the European Union.

There was a vote about leaving the European Union. Corbyn did not say clearly what he thought. He thought this would make people happy. He wanted people in some parts of Britain to like him. These people had voted to leave the European Union.

But these people did not like Corbyn. They did not trust him. The election was also about Corbyn. People did not trust him more than another leader named Johnson.

Why did people not trust Corbyn? This happened before. In the 1980s, some people in the Labour party were too extreme. Other people in the Labour party fought against them. They won.

Some leaders in Britain learned a lesson. The leader of France, Mitterrand, tried something called ""socialism."" It did not work well. People learned that extreme ideas do not work.

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were also leaders in Britain. They remembered this lesson. But this time, the extreme people took over the Labour party. We can see the bad results now.

Corbyn and his friends thought the European Union was bad. They thought it was a plan by rich people. I do not understand why they thought this.

Maybe if Corbyn had said he wanted to stay in the European Union, things would be different. Maybe there would have been no clear winner in the election. Then, they could have made deals to stop Corbyn's worst ideas.

Another leader, Jo Swinson, made a mistake. She said she did not want another vote about the European Union. But her party had wanted another vote before.

But now, this is what happened. We are here now.","A British diplomat in Washington quit her job. She could not tell lies about ""Brexit"" anymore. She thought it was wrong to say Brexit was ""done.""

There were other problems with leaders. Jeremy Corbyn made a big mistake. He was the leader of the Labour party. Some people thought he wanted Brexit. He did not clearly say what he believed about Brexit.

He thought he could please everyone. Some Labour voters in the middle and north of England voted for Brexit. Corbyn thought he could keep them happy by not taking a clear side. But these voters did not trust him.

The election was also about Corbyn himself. People did not trust him as much as they did Boris Johnson.

There is a historical reason for this. In the 1980s, the Labour party fought against the far-left group. This group was called the Militant Tendency. People like Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, and Roy Hattersley helped the Labour party win.

At the same time, people in Europe saw that socialism did not work in France. The French president, Mitterrand, tried it. He learned from his mistake. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also learned from this.

But this time, the far-left took over the Labour party. We can see the bad results now. Corbyn and his friends thought the EU was a trick by rich people. I do not understand why.

If Corbyn had supported staying in the EU, things might have been different. He could have asked for a second vote on Brexit. If he had done this clearly, there might have been no clear winner in the election. This could have stopped Corbyn's worst ideas.

Jo Swinson also made a mistake. She was the leader of another party. She said she would not have a second vote on Brexit. This was a bad choice. Her party had wanted a second vote before.

"As we wrap up the year, I thought it would be fun to look back at all the columns I have written for the Guardian and pull out the five stories that were my favorites. Why are these my favorites? Mostly because these stories captured the best and worst aspects of running a small business this year. Female-owned businesses: the US economy’s quiet success story A report earlier this year found that 42% of all firms are female-owned and women started 1,817 businesses a day in the past year. My daughter is currently watching Mad Men for the first time and was shocked at how women were treated in the workplace a mere 50 years ago. To me, that just shows how much things have changed. Unfortunately – as I also wrote here – the out-of-date attitudes of some men in positions of power continue to challenge female advancement and opportunities in the workplace. But, there’s still been a lot of progress. As I wrote: “The fact is that women have made significant gains not only in the workplace but in entrepreneurship. Of course there is still a long way to go to achieve equality. But, compared with the data from 10 or 20 years before, there’s no dispute that the environment continues to improve.” Unlimited vacation isn’t as crazy as it sounds – and it can save you money I like reporting on small business news, but I also enjoy sharing good tactics that can help small business owners grow. One of these tactics involves unlimited vacation. 2019 was a year of very tight unemployment and just about every small business owner I know struggled to find and keep good employees. So what about unlimited vacation? Don’t laugh. My report found that unlimited vacation plans can be a potential great benefit and not as costly or as risky as they may seem. As I wrote: “... the vacation benefits you offer should best suit the interests of your employees and your company’s culture. An unlimited paid time-off plan may not be the right thing for your business. But considering some of the potential financial benefits, you should at least be seriously considering it.” Could this be the worst cafe in the world? I know I’m supposed to cover American businesses, but this little restaurant in an out-of-the-way place in New Zealand was too irresistible to ignore. “Just how bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?” I wrote.","This year is ending. I want to talk about my favorite stories from the Guardian. I wrote many stories for them. I picked five stories.

These stories show the good and bad things about running a small business this year.

One story is about women who own businesses. These businesses are doing well in the US. A report said that 42% of all companies are owned by women. Women started 1,817 businesses every day last year.

My daughter is watching a TV show called Mad Men. It shows how women were treated at work 50 years ago. She was surprised. Things have changed a lot since then.

But some men in powerful jobs still have old ideas. This makes it hard for women to get better jobs. But women are still making progress.

I wrote that women are doing better at work and in business. We still need to do more to make things equal. But things are better than they were 10 or 20 years ago.

Another story is about unlimited vacation. It may sound strange, but it can save money. I like to write about small business news. I also like to share good ideas to help businesses grow.

One good idea is unlimited vacation. In 2019, it was hard to find and keep workers. Many small business owners had this problem.

So, what about unlimited vacation? It can be a good thing! It may not cost as much as you think.

I wrote that the vacation you offer should be good for your workers and your company. Unlimited vacation might not be right for every business. But it can save money, so you should think about it.

Another story is about a cafe. It might be the worst cafe in the world! I usually write about American businesses. But this cafe in New Zealand was too interesting to ignore. It was in a place that was far away.

"“So bad that people have been reportedly chased out of the cafe and others were forced to leave in tears after being abused by staff members. So bad that the police have actually been called and so bad that some of the local residents boycott the restaurant. ‘It’s an embarrassment to our community,’ one resident said. ‘You don’t have to talk to too many people before you come across somebody who’s had a bad experience there.

Why ‘Slutty Vegan’ became a hit in Atlanta – a city known for its barbecue Speaking of peculiar businesses, this one caught my attention last January because what kind of crazy person sells vegan food in the epicenter of barbecue, Atlanta, Georgia? And kills it! It’s a smart entrepreneur named Pinky Cole, a food truck owner who opened her first brick-and-mortar vegan eatery called Slutty Vegan at the beginning of the year and saw more than 1,200 people line up outside its doors on its very first day. Combining great food with an even better name, Cole’s restaurant has been a hit in 2019, attracting celebrities such as Shaquille O’Neal. She’s also laying the plans for more locations in 2020. No, she will never get me to stop eating meat – but I have to admit it will be tough to resist a Fussy Hussy (it consists of a plant-based patty with vegan cheese, shredded lettuce, onion, pickle and vegan mayo on a Hawaiian bun) the next time I’m in town. What’s the dynamic demographic running America’s small businesses? Older people OK Boomer, you’re still in charge. I’m thrilled for all the female entrepreneurs who are finally making their mark, but can we still give a small shoutout to us old people?

Another interesting business is called ""Slutty Vegan."" It is in Atlanta. Atlanta is famous for its barbecue. So, why would someone sell vegan food there?

Pinky Cole is a smart business owner. She had a food truck. Then, she opened a restaurant called Slutty Vegan. On the first day, over 1,200 people waited in line to eat there.

The food is good, and the name is interesting. Celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal have eaten there. She plans to open more restaurants soon.

I will still eat meat. But the ""Fussy Hussy"" sandwich sounds good. It has vegan cheese, lettuce, onion, pickle, and vegan mayo on a sweet bun. I might try it next time I am in Atlanta.

"In a parallel political universe, Ofwat’s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets. None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a “politicised” regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)? We’ll have to wait eight weeks – the permitted period for an appeal – to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine. First, Ofwat’s review is pitched as the “toughest ever”, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That’s not evidence of politicisation; it’s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat’s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by £50 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks. Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its “draft” and “final” calculations. Companies, in aggregate, will be allowed about £1.5bn of extra expenditure to meet performance targets. The concession is not huge in the context of a £51bn spending programme, but it’s a softening. Third, the new regime will only look “tough” to the laggards, judged by efficiency. Note how the share price of Severn Trent, one of three companies that got top-of-the-class “fast track” status during Ofwat’s review, is within pennies of its all-time high. Its shareholders see little to frighten them. Fourth, an appeal to the CMA is not a one-way bet. The competition regulator is allowed to conclude that Ofwat should have been harder.","In another world of politics, things could be different. The plan for water companies in England and Wales might not be needed. This plan is from Ofwat, for the next five years.

Maybe new ministers from the Labour party would be looking at the water companies. They might be about to make them part of the government. But this is not happening now.

So, the important question is: will the water companies complain? They have said that Ofwat is being unfair. Will they say the plan is too hard? Will they ask the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to look at it?

We have to wait eight weeks to know. This is how long they have to ask for help. But the companies that might complain should be careful.

First, Ofwat says this is the ""hardest"" plan ever. It needs to be. Since 1989, the owners of the water companies have made a lot of money. So now, Ofwat wants to do the opposite. This is not unfair. It just means the rules have been too easy.

Most people who pay water bills will think the new plan is fair. It asks for less money for the companies. It will make bills cheaper by about £50 each year. This does not include inflation. And it wants 16% less water to leak.

Second, Ofwat has changed the plan a little bit. It will let the companies spend about £1.5 billion more. This will help them reach their goals. This is not a lot of money compared to the total spending of £51 billion. But it is a little easier for the companies.

Third, the new plan will only seem ""hard"" to the companies that are not good at their job. For example, Severn Trent is a good company. It got a ""fast track"" in Ofwat's plan. This means it is doing well. The price of its shares is very high. The owners of the company are not worried.

Fourth, asking the CMA for help is not easy. The CMA could say that Ofwat should have been even stricter. So, complaining to the CMA is a risk.","In another world of politics, the rules about water prices would be different. These rules are for the water companies in England and Wales. Ofwat made these rules for the next five years. In that other world, the Labour party would be in charge. They would take over the water companies.

But that did not happen. So, we have to think about something else. The water companies are still private. They have complained about Ofwat's rules. Will they say that Ofwat is being too hard? Will they ask the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to check?

We need to wait eight weeks to know. This is how long they have to complain. But the companies should accept the rules.

First, Ofwat says these are the ""toughest ever"" rules. They needed to be tough. Since 1989, the owners of the water companies have made a lot of money. So, now it is time to change things. This is not political. It just means the rules have not been strict enough.

Most people who pay water bills will think the new rules are fair. The water companies will make less money. Bills will go down by about £50 over the next five years. This does not include changes because of inflation. There will also be 16% fewer leaks.

Second, Ofwat changed some things between the first and last versions of the rules. The water companies can spend about £1.5 billion more to do better. This is not a lot of money compared to the £51 billion they will spend in total. But it makes the rules a little easier.

Third, the new rules will only seem ""tough"" to the companies that are not doing well. For example, Severn Trent is doing well. It was one of the best companies in Ofwat's review. Its share price is almost the highest it has ever been. The owners of Severn Trent are not worried.

Fourth, complaining to the CMA is not always a good idea. The CMA could say that Ofwat should have been even harder on the water companies.","In another world, things might be different for water companies in England and Wales. The rules about how much they can charge customers would not matter. The Labour party would be in charge. They would be checking the water companies because they would own them.

But this did not happen. So, the important question is this: Will the water companies complain? They have said that the rules are unfair. Will they say that Ofwat, the water regulator, is too strict? Will they ask the CMA to look at the rules again? The CMA is another group that can check these things.

We must wait eight weeks to know for sure. The water companies have that much time to complain. But maybe it is better for them to accept the rules.

First, Ofwat says these new rules are the ""toughest ever."" They had to be strict. Since 1989, the people who own the water companies have made a lot of money. Now, things need to change. This is not unfair. It just means the rules were not strict enough before.

Most people who pay water bills will think the new rules are fair. The water companies will make less money. Bills will be about £50 lower each year for the next five years. This does not include changes because of inflation. Also, the companies must fix 16% more leaks.

Second, Ofwat has changed some things from their first plans. They will let the water companies spend about £1.5 billion more. This will help them meet the goals. This is not a lot of money compared to the £51 billion they will spend overall. But it is a small improvement for the companies.

Third, the new rules will only seem ""tough"" to the companies that are not doing well. The companies that are efficient will be fine. For example, Severn Trent is a good company. Ofwat said they were one of the best. Their stock price is very high. The people who own Severn Trent are not worried.

Fourth, asking the CMA for help is not a sure thing. The CMA could decide that Ofwat should have made even stricter rules.",0.7835583686828613,0.5,88.44998194293971,1.0,0.8844998194293971,0.7226860627040862,0.8122302889823914,0.6666666666666666,85.55168037602822,0.7362079905992946,0.7763792009400705,0.7517587188630429,0.7368741035461426,0.8,88.13784305820262,0.7,0.7913784305820261,0.7760841780427228
"That thought ought to concentrate minds in the boardrooms of the four companies – Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames and Yorkshire – that are thought most likely to appeal. It’s time for them to accept that, in a privatised but regulated system, owners have to take a hit sometimes. On – then off – the buses It’s hard to keep up with transport firm FirstGroup’s view of its best strategy. Back in May, the “future emphasis” for the group was going to be First Student and First Transit, its two North American bus contractors, since they had “the greatest potential to generate sustainable value and growth over time”. Now both operations may be sold. What’s prompted the U-turn? One can point to the arrival of David Martin as chairman in August but, since he seemed to endorse the May vision only last month, the latest development looks to be a lobbying triumph for activist investor Coast Capital, aided these days by fellow investor Robert Tchenguiz. The duo demanded a sale of all US assets, not just the Greyhound coaching business, a few weeks ago; now they may get it. A UK-only future would be a mighty come-down for FirstGroup, which can currently call itself one of the world’s largest transport companies with 100,000 employees. Indeed, even within the UK, the future of the bus division is unclear, as FirstGroup is exploring what form of “separation” is possible while meeting pension obligations. If the buses were also to exit along with the US assets, all that would be left would be the UK rail business, from which FirstGroup seemed to be contemplating an orderly retreat only a year ago. Then it won the West Coast Partnership franchise and all is now apparently right with rail. One can view this strategic soul-searching as an exercise in “rationalisation”, the polite term for a break-up. It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that there’s a simpler alternative to uncertain deal-making: just run the businesses better. Going up … ? Mike Ashley has been banging on about his “elevation” strategy for years and now he has something to show for it: a share price that elevated by 31% in a day. Context is everything, however.","Okay, here's the rewritten text, suitable for CEFR A2 level:

**Water Companies Need to Think**

Some water companies need to think carefully. These companies are Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames, and Yorkshire. People think these companies are good. They need to know that sometimes they will lose money. This is because they are private, but the government controls them.

**FirstGroup Changes its Mind**

FirstGroup is a company with buses and trains. It is hard to know what they want to do. In May, they said the future was in America. They have two bus companies there. They thought these companies would make a lot of money. But now, they might sell these American companies.

Why did they change their minds? David Martin is now the boss. He started in August. But he seemed to like the American companies last month.

Now, it looks like some people want to sell the American companies. These people are Coast Capital and Robert Tchenguiz. They asked FirstGroup to sell everything in America. Now, maybe they will.

If FirstGroup only has businesses in the UK, it will be smaller. FirstGroup is now one of the biggest transport companies in the world. It has 100,000 workers.

Even in the UK, the buses might be sold. FirstGroup is thinking about selling them. They need to pay money to old workers.

If they sell the buses and the American companies, they will only have trains in the UK. One year ago, they wanted to sell the trains too. But then they won a big train contract. Now, the trains are okay.

Maybe FirstGroup is trying to make things simpler. But maybe they should just try to do a better job with their businesses.

**FirstGroup and Buses**

It is difficult to know what FirstGroup wants to do. FirstGroup is a transport company. In May, they wanted to focus on their bus companies in America. They thought these companies would make a lot of money. Now, they might sell these American bus companies.

Why did they change their mind? David Martin became the chairman in August. But he agreed with the plan from May. So, something else must have happened.

If FirstGroup sells the American businesses and the UK buses, they will only have the UK train business. A year ago, they wanted to leave the train business. But then they won a train contract. Now, the train business is good.

Maybe FirstGroup is just making things simpler. But it seems like they should just try to run their businesses better. It is easier than selling everything.

**Water Companies Need to Think**

Four water companies should think carefully. These companies are Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames, and Yorkshire. People think these companies are good choices to buy.

These companies need to understand something. They are private companies, but the government controls them. So, the owners may lose money sometimes. This is normal in this kind of system.

**FirstGroup Changes Its Mind**

It is difficult to understand what FirstGroup wants to do. FirstGroup is a transport company. In May, they said they would focus on two things. These were First Student and First Transit. They are bus companies in North America. FirstGroup thought these companies would make a lot of money. They thought they would grow.

Now, FirstGroup might sell both of these companies. Why did they change their minds?

David Martin became the chairman in August. Maybe this is why. But he seemed to agree with the old plan last month. So, something else might be happening.

An investor named Coast Capital wanted FirstGroup to sell its US companies. Another investor, Robert Tchenguiz, helped them. Now, it looks like they will get what they want.

If FirstGroup only has UK businesses, it will be much smaller. Now, it is one of the biggest transport companies in the world. It has 100,000 workers.

Even the UK bus business is not safe. FirstGroup is thinking about what to do with it. They need to pay their workers' pensions. It is not clear what will happen.

If the buses are sold too, FirstGroup will only have the UK train business. A year ago, FirstGroup wanted to leave the train business. Then, they won a contract for the West Coast Partnership. Now, the train business seems okay.

You could say FirstGroup is ""rationalizing."" This is a nice way of saying they are breaking up the company. But maybe there is an easier way. Maybe they should just run the businesses better. It is better than selling things.

"With its army of perfectly groomed and manicured shop assistants, the department store beauty hall has traditionally been the backbone of a £2.5bn trade in expensive lipsticks, face creams or perfumes. But cosmetics sales have plummeted this year as high street shutdowns, coupled with the shift to home-working, has prompted many people to ditch their makeup bags. Sales of the designer brands sold via glossy counters in department stores are down by more than 40% this year, a decrease worth almost £500m, according to the market researcher NPD. The decline is even bigger if you throw in the £180m hit to sales of cheaper lipsticks and eyeshadows bought alongside groceries in supermarkets. Women are simply wearing less makeup, said Alexia Inge, the co-founder of the Cult Beauty website. “The lockdown expedited trends that were already happening. People were already starting to take a different approach to makeup from the Insta-glam layer-upon-layer [look].” The so-called “lipstick index” is often used as a barometer of consumer confidence during periods of economic turmoil. The term, which was coined by the former Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder in the early 2000s, refers to the usual resiliency of cosmetics with makeup seen as an affordable indulgence when bigger purchases are out of reach. But the index never saw Covid-19 coming, with its mandatory face-coverings that mean no one can even see your lips, let alone what colour they are. During the lockdown, demand for products many would once have considered an essential part of their daily beauty routine – such as foundation and lipstick – was down by more than 70%. “Everyone likes to roll out Lauder’s lipstick effect … but lipstick sales are probably the worst of any category right now,” said Inge. Instead, she added, we should look at skincare, which is the “makeup equivalent” of the leisurewear people have been wearing at home during the pandemic. While Cult Beauty’s lipstick sales were down 8%, its skincare sales have more than doubled. This dramatic shift in spending priorities is borne out in figures from the department store chain John Lewis.","Big shops sell a lot of makeup. They have many shop workers who look very nice. They sell things like lipstick, cream for your face, and perfume. These things are usually expensive.

But this year, the shops have sold less makeup. The shops had to close because of the virus. Also, many people are working at home. So, people are not using as much makeup.

The makeup sold in big shops is down by 40%. This means the shops made less money. They lost about £500 million.

Even the cheaper makeup is selling less. The makeup sold in supermarkets is also down. This means the shops lost another £180 million.

Alexia Inge works for a website called Cult Beauty. She says that women are wearing less makeup. She says that the virus made this happen faster. People were already using less makeup before.

People often look at lipstick sales to see how the economy is doing. This is called the ""lipstick index."" When people cannot buy big things, they buy lipstick instead. Lipstick is a small treat.

But the virus changed everything. People need to wear masks. So, you cannot see their lips.

During the lockdown, people bought less makeup. They bought less foundation and lipstick. These things are usually part of their daily routine. The sales went down by 70%.

Alexia Inge says that lipstick sales are very bad right now. Instead, people are buying more skincare. Skincare is like the makeup version of clothes for relaxing at home.

Cult Beauty sold less lipstick, down by 8%. But they sold more than double the skincare products. People are spending their money on different things now.

The shop John Lewis also saw this change.","Big shops called department stores usually sell a lot of beauty products. They have nice shop assistants who sell things like lipstick and perfume. These products are often expensive. They used to sell about £2.5 billion worth of them. This was important for their business.

But this year, they are not selling as much. The shops had to close because of the virus. Also, many people are working from home. So, they are not using makeup as much.

The sales of expensive makeup in department stores have gone down a lot. They are down more than 40%. This is about £500 million less than before.

Even cheaper makeup sold in supermarkets is not selling as well. These sales are down by £180 million. Women are using less makeup now.

A woman named Alexia Inge said that things were already changing. People were starting to use less makeup before the virus. The virus just made this change happen faster. People are not doing ""Insta-glam"" looks anymore.

There is a saying called the ""lipstick index."" It means that when the economy is bad, people still buy lipstick. Lipstick is a small treat when you cannot buy big things.

But the virus changed things. People have to wear masks. So, you cannot see their lips. Because of this, the ""lipstick index"" does not work now.

During the time when everyone had to stay home, people bought much less makeup. They did not buy foundation and lipstick as much. Sales went down by more than 70%.

Alexia Inge said that lipstick is not selling well now. She said that skincare is selling better. Skincare is like the makeup version of comfortable clothes that people wear at home.

Her company, Cult Beauty, sold less lipstick. Lipstick sales went down by 8%. But skincare sales went up a lot. They more than doubled.

The shop John Lewis also saw this change. People are spending their money on different things now.","The beauty section in big stores used to be very important. They sold expensive makeup, like lipstick and creams. This business was worth a lot of money.

But now, things have changed. Many stores had to close. People started working from home. Because of this, many people stopped using makeup.

The sales of expensive makeup in big stores are much lower. They are down by more than 40%. This means they lost almost £500 million. A company called NPD found this out.

Even cheaper makeup is not selling well. The sales of cheap lipsticks and eyeshadows are down by £180 million. These are the ones people buy in supermarkets.

Alexia Inge is the boss of a website called Cult Beauty. She said that women are wearing less makeup. The lockdown made this happen faster. People were already changing how they used makeup. They were using less than before.

There is something called the ""lipstick index."" It shows how confident people are during bad economic times. If people buy lipstick, it means they are still spending money. It is like a small treat when they cannot buy big things.

But the ""lipstick index"" did not predict Covid-19. Now, people have to wear masks. You cannot see their lips, or the color of their lipstick.

During the lockdown, people bought much less makeup. They did not buy things like foundation and lipstick as much. The sales were down by more than 70%.

Alexia Inge said that lipstick sales are the worst right now.

Instead, people are buying skincare products. Skincare is like comfortable clothes for your face. People wear comfortable clothes when they stay home.

Cult Beauty sold less lipstick, but they sold much more skincare. Their lipstick sales went down by 8%. But their skincare sales more than doubled.

The store John Lewis also saw this change in what people are buying.",0.7362927794456482,0.5,81.1622848200313,1.0,0.8116228482003129,0.6826385425486537,0.8344125747680664,0.6666666666666666,82.20824786324788,0.819793803418803,0.7680206196581197,0.7563666203642843,0.8053451776504517,0.8,82.69258103762928,0.7,0.7369258103762928,0.7807569960089148
"Its sales of skincare, body and hair products are up 234% this year, as people opt to spend time caring for their skin rather than applying makeup. John Lewis predicts some of the changes seen this year will stay around and that cosmetics bags will get smaller as women abandon lip pencils and contouring sticks – a hard-to-do blending technique popularised by Kim Kardashian – and switch to easy to use multipurpose products, such as tinted moisturiser and lip balm. Long periods at home have driven shoppers into the arms of Cult Beauty and its discount-driven Lookfantastic, which is part of The Hut Group founded by the billionaire Matthew Moulding. In common with other retail markets such as furniture, more than 40% of beauty sales will be online this year – almost double 2019’s level. The failure of a major player like Debenhams, with its 124 stores and 12,000 staff, is a fresh blow for the beauty industry left reeling by this year’s lengthy salon closures. Yes, times are tough for the high street, said June Jensen-Mills, the head of UK beauty at market researchers NPD, but store sales are likely to bounce back in 2021. “I believe that bricks and mortar will go back to being important,” she said. “People will want to meet up with friends, try things, have a coffee. Debenhams is an important player in the world of beauty but when a retailer closes customers shift to similar retailers where they feel at home.” There are also new powerful forces at work in the industry as the glitzy websites of blockbuster brands such as Charlotte Tilbury compete with the department stores that are also their business partners. For shoppers the joy of the beauty hall lies in the ability to discover new brands, trial out textures, test colours and sample scents, but coronavirus restrictions mean that is, in many cases, no longer possible. But department stores brands are fighting back with innovative new ways of selling, such as virtual masterclasses and compiling “discovery boxes” of sample-sized products. People seem to like it.","Sales of some beauty products are much higher this year. The sales are up 234%.
People are buying more skin care, body, and hair products. They want to take care of their skin. They are not using much makeup.

John Lewis thinks some changes will stay. People may not buy as much makeup in the future. Women may stop using some makeup products. For example, lip pencils and contouring sticks may not be popular. These makeup products are hard to use. Kim Kardashian made contouring popular. But now, women want easy products. They want to use things like tinted moisturiser and lip balm. These products do many things.

"Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than scheduled before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19 border closures. The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions.","Toyota will stop making cars in Britain and France. This will happen sooner than planned because of problems with Covid-19.

"Shaftesbury, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has slumped to a £700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End braces for tougher Covid-19 restrictions. The company, which owns parts of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, has been hit by the sharp fall in the number of tourists and office workers coming into the capital. It said vacancies at its shops, restaurants and offices had nearly tripled to 10.2% in the year to 30 September. As tenants struggled to pay their rent, Shaftesbury’s net income fell by 24% to £74.3 . It collected only 53% of the rent due in the second half of the year. This resulted in an annual loss after tax of £699.5m, compared with a profit of £26m the previous year. Shaftesbury wrote down the value of its portfolio by 18.3% to £3.1bn, as the amount of empty space in the West End increased, rental income fell and physical distancing measures reduced demand from retail and office tenants for more space. Brian Bickell, the Shaftesbury chief executive, said: “Rarely in history has the world seen such widespread disruption to normal patterns of life. Only now are we seeing the first positive signs that conditions will begin to improve in the year ahead.” Shaftesbury said its leasing activity had declined sharply since February due to the pandemic and was below normal levels, although there had been a pickup in inquiries in recent weeks. The pandemic has also forced landlords to rewrite lease agreements to help tenants get through the crisis, and Shaftesbury moved permanently to monthly rents for most commercial tenants from October. The company said its rental and service charge support for tenants was likely to continue through 2021, “with our occupiers having reduced income in the important period leading up to Christmas and into the new year, which traditionally has provided them with liquidity buffers to withstand the normally slower quarter to March”. London is among the areas that enter tier 3 restrictions on Wednesday, which means hotels, pubs, bars and restaurants have to close again and can only do takeaways and deliver. Shaftesbury gave a gloomy outlook for next year, predicting that pandemic control measures were “likely for much of 2021”.","Shaftesbury is a big owner of buildings in London.

"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors how the UK is faring compared with other countries.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

Britain's economy is having problems. COVID-19 infections are growing fast. There are new rules because of the virus. Brexit is also causing problems. This year has been the worst for the economy in 300 years.

Brexit talks are happening now. There are long lines of trucks at Dover. Brexit will happen on New Year's Eve. The UK economy is not growing. Shops are selling less. More people are losing their jobs. This is the fastest rate ever.

December started with good news. A British woman got the first COVID-19 vaccine. But now, the virus is getting worse. The government is making new rules before Christmas.

A new type of COVID-19 is spreading quickly in the UK. Brexit talks are hard. France stopped trucks from coming to the UK. This made problems in Kent. A ""no-deal"" Brexit could cause more problems.

The British economy got better after the lockdown in the spring. It got better faster than expected. People hoped the vaccine would end the crisis soon. But now, experts think the economy will get worse again. There will be more lockdowns in 2021. The vaccine will take time to give to everyone.

"In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”","Here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

The economy has had some good news lately. Businesses started to do better in December. This was after the second lockdown in England.

The rules in autumn did not hurt the economy as much as before. Official numbers show that the economy got better faster in the summer. People went back to work quickly after the first lockdown.

But the numbers also show that the economy started to get worse again before November. This was before the new rules about Covid.

The Bank of England said the economy will get smaller at the end of the year. It may stay weak in early 2021. This is because there will still be rules to stop Covid from spreading. People need to wait for the vaccine.

The government knows that businesses are having problems again. So, the government will help pay workers until the end of April. This is longer than planned.

This help for workers is costing the government a lot of money. In November, many more people needed this help. About five million workers got money. This shows that companies are having a hard time.

The government will talk about the economy on March 3. They will say what they will do to help with the pandemic.

Some groups say that more help is needed now. They want to help businesses and workers while the rules are in place.

In October, many people lost their jobs. This was when the government was going to stop helping pay workers. But then they changed their mind and gave more help.

Next year, many people may not have jobs. About 2.6 million people could be without work. This is when the help for workers stops.

One person said that some jobs may not come back. These jobs are in places like pubs and restaurants. He thinks people may change their habits after the pandemic. So, some jobs may disappear.","Here is the text rewritten at CEFR B1 level:

"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles will be forced to pay back about £14m missing from the company’s employee retirement fund, after being refused permission to appeal against a pensions ombudsman’s ruling. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted for years by a series of UK government ministers, was told by the regulator in June to refund three retirement funds he controlled as trustee, following an ombudsman ruling that he had acted dishonestly. The ombudsman’s decision followed an investigation triggered by claims brought by 30 members that Garner had repeatedly failed to return their funds when they were due. The Pension Schemes Act requires trustees to transfer pensions within six months of an application. The court’s refusal to entertain Garner’s request to appeal is another blow for the businessman, who appears to have been pushed a step closer to personal bankruptcy. He is already the subject of a personal bankruptcy petition filed by Leicester city council. The repayment of the £14m to the pension holders, the vast majority of whom were never Norton employees, had been on hold while the court considered Garner’s request for permission to appeal. In an August order delaying the payment, Mr Justice Fancourt said: “The sum likely to be payable … is extremely large and it is readily understandable that [Garner] will not be able to pay it and that, as a result, he is liable to be made bankrupt.” In his latest judgment refusing an appeal, however, Fancourt stated: “There could have been no good reason to delay the payment of compensation unless there was compelling evidence that it would be provided by other means within the timescale specified by the ombudsman.” Garner has been granted permission to appeal against a further £180,000 in distress payments to 30 of the scheme’s 228 members, to whom he had repeatedly failed to return funds when they were due. The businessman’s law firm said: “Mr Garner has been granted permission to appeal the inconvenience award, and has renewed his application for permission to appeal in respect of the refusal.” Garner, who was the trustee of three Norton pension funds, invested all of the members’ savings into his own company, but Norton slumped into administration on 29 January.","A man used to own a company called Norton Motorcycles.

"The ombudsman’s determination in the summer stated: “The trustee has acted dishonestly and in breach of his duty of no conflict, his duty not to profit and his duty to act with prudence.” The decision followed a Guardian and ITV News investigation in January that showed how 228 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares after they had been duped by a fraudster. Garner received the retirement savings during 2012 and 2013, after a scam that resulted in a promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way he had sold the scheme. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes, Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley, were convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions.

Someone named Garner received the pension money. This happened in 2012 and 2013. Before this, someone called Simon Colfer cheated people. He sold the pension plan in a bad way. He was found guilty of fraud in 2018.

Two other people were also involved. Their names are Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley. They helped set up the Norton pension plans. They did something illegal with taxes in 2013. They took back £5 million in tax money. This money was supposed to be for fake pension payments.

Documents from the court case showed something. £990,000 from the fraud was given to Garner. He used it to buy Norton in 2008.

Garner says he did nothing wrong. He says he is also a victim. He says he did not know he was working with dishonest people.",0.8062216639518738,0.5,88.13250000000001,1.0,0.8813249999999999,0.7291822213172913,0.8275598287582397,0.3333333333333333,84.5304428341385,0.7617389291465375,0.7738261070853462,0.644906423058973,0.8317712545394897,0.6,79.83677401129944,0.7,0.7083677401129943,0.7133796648841614
"Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are much more likely than white people to work in hospitality, one of the sectors hardest hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic as restaurants, bars and other venues have been shut for months during the lockdowns. About one in 12 (8%) workers from BAME backgrounds are employed in hospitality roles. That compares with about one in 20 (5%) white British workers, research from the Resolution Foundation shows. Overall, 300,000 people from BAME backgrounds work in hospitality. The thinktank’s report found that even before the pandemic hit, hospitality was one of the lowest paying sectors in the economy, with a typical hourly pay of £8.72. It said that 23% of hospitality workers were paid at or below the national living wage. The research found that BAME workers in the sector also faced “pay penalties” – pay gaps that account for workers’ age, qualifications, experience, and the kinds of jobs they do – relative to white British workers. “Crucially, these pay penalties are bigger than the raw pay gaps found in official earnings data – suggesting that the extent of disadvantage is bigger than previously thought,” the report said. BAME men were paid 65p an hour less than white British men on average, the report found. BAME women were also underpaid compared with white British women but the gap was less severe. The report found that while hospitality as a whole disproportionately employed young people – over a third of its workforce were aged 16-24 – this was not always the case for BAME workers. For example, the typical age of a Bangladeshi worker in hospitality was 42 – higher than the typical age for Bangladeshi workers across the whole economy (35), and higher than white British workers in hospitality (28). Indian workers in hospitality were among the highest paid ethnic group per hour (£8.96) and among the most likely to be in high-paying occupations (28%) such as hotel and restaurant managers. This corresponds with 41% of Indian hospitality workers holding a degree. In comparison, one in four Bangladeshi hospitality workers had no qualifications and typically earned 12% less than Indian hospitality workers, at £7.85 an hour.","People of color are more likely to work in hotels and restaurants. These people are Black, Asian, or from another ethnic group. We call them BAME.

Hotels and restaurants are having problems now. This is because of the pandemic. Many places are closed.

Eight out of 100 BAME workers work in hotels and restaurants. Only five out of 100 white British workers work there. This information comes from a study.

About 300,000 BAME people work in hotels and restaurants.

The study also said that hotels and restaurants did not pay much. Before the pandemic, people got about £8.72 per hour. This is not a lot of money.

About 23 out of 100 workers in hotels and restaurants got very low pay. This pay was at or below the national living wage.

BAME workers also had problems with their pay. They got less money than white British workers. This was true even when they had the same age, skills, and jobs.

The study said that BAME people had more problems than we thought. They were paid less than white British people.

BAME men got 65p less per hour than white British men. BAME women also got less money than white British women. But the difference was smaller.

Many young people work in hotels and restaurants. More than a third of workers are between 16 and 24 years old. But this is not always true for BAME workers.

For example, many Bangladeshi workers in hotels and restaurants are older. The average age is 42. This is older than Bangladeshi workers in other jobs. It is also older than white British workers in hotels and restaurants.

Indian workers in hotels and restaurants got more money. They earned about £8.96 per hour. Many of them had good jobs, like managers.

"Nye Cominetti, the senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “As workers from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately likely to work in hospitality, a significant number of workers risk moving into unemployment when the furlough scheme ends in the spring. “The government should bear that in mind for the jobs support programmes it is providing.” A report by the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association and the consultancy Oxford Economics has previously warned that 291,000 jobs in the hospitality trade could be lost as a result of coronavirus restrictions. The forecast was based on industry data suggesting that 25% of pubs could close, with the remainder barely breaking even as they struggle to cope with reduced custom and limited opening hours. Oxford Economics said the worst-case scenario would reduce the sector’s economic output by £7.4bn and cut wages by £3.9bn.","Here is the text rewritten for CEFR A2 level English:

"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain &amp; Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure. Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain &amp; Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales. The 1,300 employees in Brains pubs will transfer to Marston’s, which employs a further 14,000 people across the UK.","A Welsh company called SA Brain & Co owns many pubs.

"Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year. Furniture retailers reported a 5.3% rise, as consumers invested in big ticket items. Britons treated themselves – as well as friends and family they could not see – to flowers throughout the year, with spending at florists rising 22.7%. Crafts and hobby spending increased 9.8%, and pets were given extra attention with vet and pet retail increasing 10.7%. But the report also shows how much restaurants suffered despite Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” initiative over the summer. Restrictions throughout the rest of the year contributed to a 47% drop in restaurant spending, while bars and pubs took a 36.7% hit. However, Covid restrictions contributed to a 49.1% rise in spending on online takeaway orders, while meal subscription services jumped 62.4%. Demand for at-home entertainment pushed spending on digital subscriptions up 31.5%, while money spent on electronics including game consoles rose 10.8%.","In 2020, there was a virus called Covid.

People could not travel easily. Many people worked from home. So, they shopped in their local areas instead of going to big cities.

Barclaycard has information about how people spent their money. They found that spending at small food shops increased a lot. These shops include butchers, bakers, and places that sell alcohol. Spending at these shops went up by about 29% compared to the year before.

But overall, people spent less money. Total spending went down by about 7%. This is because people could not go on holiday or spend money in restaurants and city centers.

Barclaycard also found that people spent more on important things like food. This spending went up by about 4%. But they spent less on things that were not important. This spending went down by about 11%.

Big department stores had a very hard time. Spending in these stores went down by about 17%. Shops that sold clothes also did badly. Their sales went down by about 16%. This caused problems for some big companies.

But discount shops that have physical stores did well. Their sales went up by about 25%. This is because many people lost their jobs or earned less money. So, they wanted to find good deals.

People spent more time at home. So, they started doing projects to improve their homes. After the shops opened again in June, people bought a lot of things for their homes. This made spending at DIY and home goods stores go up by about 10% for the whole year.

Shops that sold furniture also did well. Their sales went up by about 5%. People bought new furniture for their homes.

People also bought flowers for themselves and for their friends and family. Spending on flowers went up by about 23%.

"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets. Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips &amp; Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective.","Evans is a shop that sells clothes for bigger people.

"Retail sales fell by 3.8% in November on the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown in England and restrictions elsewhere in the UK shut much of the high street. Ending a six-month run of rising sales, the figures revealed the impact of the pandemic on the sector as the infection rate increased across the country. A 19% fall in clothing sales followed the closure of most department stores and non-essential shops. A government message that workers should stay at home if they could caused car journeys to slump and petrol sales to follow suit, with a 16.6% decline. The only bright spot for retailers was an increase in the sale of household goods of 1.6% as shoppers went online to stock up for Christmas. Supermarkets and food stores increased sales by 3.1%. Analysts said it was no surprise the lockdown bolstered online shopping to a record total of 31.4% of all spending, after an increase of almost 75% since November 2019. The Office for National Statistics said 90% of businesses continued to trade in some form through the month, mostly via a click-and-collect service. But only 68.8% of department stores continued trading. Meanwhile, many online retailers reported a boom in sales, as they did during the UK-wide lockdown in spring, though heavy discounting helped to keep the tills ringing. The ONS said this week price-cutting by clothing retailers last month pushed UK inflation down to 0.3%, from 0.7% a month earlier. The Bank of England’s inflation target is 2%. Aled Patchett, the head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: “November’s sales highlight once again the polarising effect of Covid-19 on retail. Sectors like grocery and homeware perform well – and should be expected to have a strong finish to the year – while others including big-name high street brands fall foul of significantly reduced footfall. “Despite most shoppers having wrapped up their Covid Christmas shopping online this year, shops – particularly in smaller towns – will be hoping that the vaccine rollout inspires greater consumer confidence in the new year as people return to city centres for both work and play.” In October, a 6.4% increase in online sales spurred a 1.2% rise in the total volume of retail spending, mainly driven by shoppers rushing to buy early Christmas presents before the second lockdown in England.","Okay, here's the rewritten text for CEFR A2 level:

"The UK public’s appetite for eating out has plunged to its weakest since the spring amid growing evidence of the impact of the Omicron variant on the hospitality sector during its crucial pre-Christmas period. The number of seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week ending 20 December to 88% of the level in the same period of 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the weekly digest of flash economic indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Using data from the online restaurant booking site OpenTable and other sources, the ONS said Britons were eating out less and working from home more in response to rising infection rates and the government’s plan B measures. Amid widespread reports of bookings being cancelled, the drop in the number of diners in the latest week was the sharpest since early September and the lowest level since restaurants reopened indoors in England, Scotland and Wales in May after last winter’s lockdown. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. Restaurants in London have been especially hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite an eight-point drop on the week, the number of diners stood at 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS said the number of firms reporting staff working from home in the latest two weeks had risen by two points to 14%, with a marked impact on businesses reliant on consumers. Transactions at Pret a Manger sandwich outlets were lower in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in regional towns remained above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped by 29 points to barely 50% of the January 2020 level. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with footfall in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level – a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago. Earlier this week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced an emergency £1bn package to help businesses struggling with the impact of Omicron.","Here's the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

"Ikea has increased the price of its flat-pack furniture by up to 50%, blaming supply chain costs caused by Covid-19, in a move that will further stoke growing concern about the rising cost of living. After customers complained that prices appeared to have risen sharply after Christmas, the retailer said it was no longer able to absorb increased costs and was passing them on to consumers. An Ikea spokesperson tweeted: “Unfortunately, there has been a significant increase in costs across the supply chain, including in raw materials, transport and logistics. As this is still ongoing, it is necessary to increase prices across many of our products.” Archived versions of Ikea’s website from as recently as October showed significant price increases, including a Malm desk that has gone up from £99 to £150, a jump of more than 50%. A Jokkmokk table with four chairs is also up 50%, from £99 to £149, compared with earlier this year. A Hemnes daybed has gone up from £215 to £279, a 30% rise, while an Alex nine-drawer unit increased 35% from £85 to £115, according to archived versions of the Ikea website from earlier this year.

Ikea confirmed that the company had raised prices across multiple countries and ranges. A spokesperson said: “Since the start of the pandemic, Ikea has managed to absorb the significant cost increases experienced across the supply chain while keeping prices as low and stable as we possibly can. Now, like many other retailers, we have had to raise our prices to mitigate the impact on our business. “Price increases vary but remain in line with what we are seeing globally at Ikea, which is approximately a 9% average increase across countries and the product range. Affordability remains at the heart of our business, and our focus will always be on continuing to offer quality, sustainable home furnishings at an affordable price for the many people.” Ikea warned earlier this year that prices would rise, citing factors including bottlenecks in shipping raw materials from Asia to Europe.","Ikea sells furniture that you build yourself.

"The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation. Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers could expect their bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April. While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers. The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again. Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year. On Thursday, the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up. One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years.","The government will have meetings soon.

Energy UK is a group for energy companies. They said bills could go up a lot from April 1. The bills could go up by 50%.

But Energy UK said these changes would not save people much money. They would save less than £300. The average energy bill is expected to go up by £600.

The energy industry is thinking about a plan. In this plan, the government would give loans to energy companies. This would make the price increases happen slowly over several years.",0.799807071685791,0.5,83.57282820258195,1.0,0.8357282820258194,0.7118451179038701,0.7952410578727722,0.6666666666666666,82.57287982677735,0.8106780043305661,0.7689321995669433,0.7436133080354607,0.7668597102165222,0.8,80.14072949002221,0.7,0.711407294900222,0.7594223350389147
"The plan would involve one or more commercial lenders – such as banks – covering the immediate cost of buying energy on wholesale markets at record prices, with a sum of at least £7bn. The loans would not require a government guarantee, but officials would be responsible for ensuring repayments. “We regularly engage with the energy industry and will continue to ensure that consumers are protected through the energy price cap, which is insulating millions from record global gas prices,” a government spokesperson said. “We also continue to support those most in need through our £500mhousehold support fund, the warm home discount and winter fuel payments.”","Here is a simplified version of the text, written at CEFR A2 level:

Some banks can give money to energy companies.
The energy companies need money to buy energy.

"On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gave a mid-year economic update predicting a solid economic bounceback from Covid restrictions. We’ve looked under the hood to see what the treasury’s crystal ball says is in store for the economy, what might go wrong, and how government finances will fare if they’re right. Forecasts The budget papers project the Australian economy will grow in real terms by 3.75% in 2021-22 and 3.5% in 2022-23, before easing back to 2.25% and 2.5% in the final two years of the forward projections. The unemployment rate is tipped to fall to 4.25% in that time. The treasury thinks Australians will be ambitious with their pay demands and bosses generous in a bid to keep workers, because wages growth is supposed to take off from 2.25% in 2021-22 to 3.25% in 2024-25. Inflation is projected to reach and stay at the mid-point of the reserve bank’s target range (2.5%) in 2022-23. Assumptions The treasury has assumed that with more than 80% of Australians aged 16 and above now vaccinated, rates will climb to more than 90%. So far so good. But the rest of the assumptions are … a little rosy. The treasury assumed lockdowns will no longer be required, with “most domestic activity restrictions” lifted by the start of 2022 and only basic density restrictions in place. There may be “temporary strengthening of activity restrictions” to contain localised outbreaks – but these short, sharp lockdown-like restrictions are assumed to have no material impact on the outlook. Remaining state border restrictions are assumed to be lifted by early 2022 and the Omicron variant “is not assumed to significantly alter current reopening plans or require a reimposition of widespread health and activity restrictions”. Migrants will start returning from 2022, with international students ready to go for the first semester of next year. What could go wrong In a word: Covid. If a new variant of concern emerges (beyond Omicron) requiring more significant health responses, the international border could be closed for another six months and public health orders and precautionary behaviour could drive down spending.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

**The Economy in Australia**

On Thursday, Josh Frydenberg talked about the economy. He said the economy will get better after the COVID problems. We looked at what the government thinks will happen. We wanted to know what could go wrong. We also wanted to know how the government's money will be if they are right.

**What the Government Thinks**

The government thinks the economy will grow. It will grow by 3.75% this year. Next year, it will grow by 3.5%. After that, it will grow slower. The government also thinks less people will be without jobs. They think 4.25% of people will be without jobs.

The government thinks people will want more money. They also think bosses will give more money to workers. They want to keep the workers. So, the government thinks wages will go up. This year, wages will go up by 2.25%. In a few years, wages will go up by 3.25%.

The government thinks prices will go up a little. This is called inflation. They think inflation will be 2.5% next year.

**What the Government Believes**

The government believes many people have gotten the vaccine. They think more than 80% of people over 16 have had the vaccine. They think this number will go up to 90%.

But some of the other things they believe might not be right. The government believes we will not need lockdowns anymore. They think most rules will be gone by the start of next year. They think there will only be a few rules about how many people can be in a place.

They think if there is a new small COVID problem, it will not last long. They think these small problems will not change the economy much.

The government believes the borders between states will open soon. They also think the new COVID type called Omicron will not stop things from opening.

The government believes people will come to Australia from other countries in 2022. They think students from other countries will come to study next year.

**What Could Be Bad**

COVID could be bad. If there is a new COVID type that is very bad, the borders might close again. People might be scared and not spend money. This would be bad for the economy.","On Thursday, a man named Josh Frydenberg talked about the economy. He said the economy will get better after the Covid problems. He thinks things will be good for the economy.

We looked at what the government thinks will happen. We wanted to know what the future might be like for the economy. We also wanted to know what problems could happen. We checked how the government will do with money if the predictions are right.

The government thinks the economy will grow. It will grow by 3.75% this year. Next year, it will grow by 3.5%. After that, the growth will be a little slower. It will be 2.25% and then 2.5% in the next two years.

The government also thinks fewer people will be without jobs. The number of people without jobs will go down to 4.25%.

The government thinks people will want more money. They think bosses will give workers more money to keep them working there. So, wages will increase. This year, wages will grow by 2.25%. In a few years, wages will grow by 3.25%.

The government thinks prices will go up a little. The price increase will be 2.5% in 2022-23. This is the middle of what the bank wants.

The government is making some guesses about the future. They think that most people will get the vaccine. They think over 90% of people will get it.

But the other guesses might be too good to be true. The government thinks there will be no more lockdowns. They think most rules will be gone by the start of 2022. There will only be a few simple rules.

Maybe there will be some small rules to stop the virus in some places. But the government thinks these small rules will not hurt the economy.

The government thinks the borders between states will open soon, by early 2022. They also think the new virus, Omicron, will not change the plan to open up. They think it will not make the government put back the old rules.

The government thinks students from other countries will come back in 2022. They will be ready for school next year.

What could go wrong? Covid. If a new virus comes, it could be bad. If the new virus needs more rules to stop it, the borders could close again. People might be scared and not spend money.","On Thursday, Josh Frydenberg spoke about the economy. He is the treasurer. He said the economy will get better after the Covid rules.

We looked at what the government thinks about the economy. We wanted to know what could happen. We also wanted to know if the government's plans will work.

The government thinks the economy will grow. It will grow by 3.75% this year. Next year, it will grow by 3.5%. After that, it will grow slower. In the last two years, it will grow by 2.25% and 2.5%.

The government thinks the unemployment rate will go down. It will go down to 4.25%.

The government also thinks people will want more money. Bosses will give them more money to keep them working. Wages will grow from 2.25% to 3.25% in a few years.

The government is making some guesses. They think that most people will get vaccinated. More than 80% of people over 16 have already had the vaccine. The government thinks it will go up to 90%. This is good so far.

But other guesses might not be right. The government thinks there will be no more lockdowns. They think most rules will be gone by the start of 2022. There might be some small rules about how many people can be in a place.

They think there might be some short lockdowns if there are small outbreaks. But they think these lockdowns will not hurt the economy much.

The government thinks state borders will open soon. They also think the Omicron virus will not change the plans to open up. They don't think it will make them put rules back in place.

The government thinks people will start coming to Australia again in 2022. International students will be ready to come to school next year.

What could go wrong? The biggest problem is Covid. If a new virus comes, it could be bad. The borders might close again for six months.

"The treasury projects this could mean 1% is shaved off gross domestic product in 2021-22, and unemployment is about 1% higher. The rebound would instead come in the second half of 2022. The papers also note that revenue assumptions and nominal GDP are also sensitive to changes in the iron ore price, with a US$10 fall shaving $3.9bn off GDP this year and $0.9bn off tax receipts next financial year. If the government has to pay higher interest rates on bonds, then debt could blow out by a further 5.4% of GDP by 2032. $16bn of mystery spending The budget papers reveal that there is about $16bn of mystery spending over the next four years, consisting of decisions taken but not announced, or measures for which the cost is not-for-publication. That’s more than 10 times the size of mystery spending last year. The papers make it impossible to calculate the size of the war chest for announcements to be made before the election, by mixing in a bunch of commercially sensitive spending items like vaccine purchases. But a treasury official in the lockup suggested it was about half and half … so, an $8bn war chest for the election. There will also be $940m more revenue collected due to decisions taken but not announced or not for publication measures. Debt and deficit For a government previously concerned with the debt and deficit disaster, there is still red as far as the eye can see. The deficit is tipped to be $99.2bn in 2021-22, an improvement of $7.4bn since the budget despite the Delta lockdowns. The deficit will still be $57.5bn in 2024-25 (or 2.3% of GDP), and only shrinks to 1.8% of GDP in 2031-32. Net debt is projected to be 30.6% of GDP at June 2022, rising to a peak of 37.4% in 2025, then down to 35.5% in 2032. The papers say that despite the economic recovery the government is sticking with the first plank of its budget plan – strong and sustained recovery – so don’t expect austerity measures to try to cut the debt and deficit.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at CEFR A2 level:

**The Economy**

The government thinks the economy will be a little worse.
This could mean that the country makes 1% less money in 2021 and 2022.
Also, more people, about 1%, might not have jobs.
The economy will get better in the second half of 2022.

The price of iron is important.
If the price of iron goes down by $10, the country will make $3.9 billion less this year.
Next year, the government will get $0.9 billion less money from taxes.

The government borrows money by selling bonds.
If the government has to pay more money to borrow, the country's debt could get much bigger.
It could grow by 5.4% by 2032. This is a lot of money.

**Secret Money**

The government has some secret plans.
These plans will cost about $16 billion over the next four years.
We do not know what these plans are.
The government has made decisions, but has not told anyone.
Or, they do not want to say how much things cost.
This secret money is much more than last year. Last year, there was less secret money.

It is hard to know how much money the government will use before the election.
The government is buying things like vaccines.
The prices of these things are secret.
But someone from the government said that about half of the $16 billion is for the election.
So, about $8 billion might be used for the election.

The government will also get more money.
They will get $940 million more because of secret plans.

**Debt and Deficit**

The government used to worry about debt. Debt is the money the government owes.
They also worried about the deficit. The deficit is when the government spends more money than it gets.
But now, the government still has a lot of debt and deficit.

The government will spend $99.2 billion more than it gets in 2021 and 2022.
This is a little better than before.
The deficit will still be $57.5 billion in 2024 and 2025.
In 2031 and 2032, the deficit will be a little smaller.

The country's debt will be 30.6% of the money it makes in June 2022.
The debt will get bigger until 2025. Then, it will get a little smaller.

The government wants the economy to get better.
They will not cut spending to reduce the debt and deficit.","The government thinks the economy will be a little worse. This could mean the country makes 1% less money in 2021 and 2022. Also, more people could be out of work, about 1%.

The economy should get better in the second half of 2022. The price of iron ore is important. If the price goes down by $10, the country will make $3.9 billion less this year. Next year, the government will get $0.9 billion less in taxes.

The government sells bonds to get money. If the government has to pay more interest on these bonds, the country's debt could get much bigger. It could be 5.4% more of the country's money by 2032.

There is also some money that is not explained. The government will spend about $16 billion over the next four years. We do not know what it is for. It is much more than last year.

The government thinks things might not be so good. The economy might grow less. They think the economy could grow 1% less than expected in 2021 and 2022. Also, more people might lose their jobs. About 1% more people could be unemployed. The economy might get better again in the second half of 2022.

The government also makes money from iron ore. If the price of iron ore goes down, the government will have less money. If the price goes down by $10, the economy will lose $3.9 billion this year. Next year, the government will get $0.9 billion less in taxes.

The government borrows money by selling bonds. If the government has to pay more interest on these bonds, the country's debt could get much bigger. The debt could increase by 5.4% of the total economy by 2032.

The budget papers show some spending that is not explained. There is $16 billion of spending that is secret. This money is for things the government has decided to do, but they have not told anyone yet. Or, they do not want to say how much these things cost. This secret spending is much bigger than last year. It is more than ten times bigger.

It is hard to know how much money the government has for announcements before the election. This is because they have mixed secret spending with things that are private. For example, they are buying vaccines. However, someone from the government said that about half of the $16 billion is for the election. So, they might have $8 billion to spend before the election.

The government will also get more money. They will get $940 million more because of decisions they have made. But they have not told anyone about these decisions.

"Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll. Global supply chain problems prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world. The government has argued that the shortages are part of a worldwide pattern and no worse in the UK than elsewhere, although logistics experts and other professionals – particularly in the food sector - have said the problems are amplified in Britain by a shortage of east European workers, including drivers, since Brexit. The YouGov poll showed residents of the UK were multiple times more likely to have experienced, or to know people who have experienced, shortages of food and fuel than people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, and somewhat more likely to have experienced them than those in the US. Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had. The corresponding figures in the US were 49% and 10%, but in continental Europe, the proportion of people who said they had been personally affected was between three and nine times lower: 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% and 6% in Italy. The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages. The UK was also the only country where substantial numbers of people said they had experienced fuel shortages in recent weeks, since the crisis in September and October. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country. Only 8% of German respondents, 7% of those in France and 5% of those in Italy said they had been personally experienced fuel scarcity, with 37%, 38% and 53% respectively saying they had not even heard of the issue – compared with just 11% of respondents in Britain.","Here is the text rewritten in CEFR A2 level English:

Many people in the UK had problems getting food and fuel. This happened more often in the UK than in some countries in Europe.

The world had problems with getting things where they needed to go. This started during the pandemic. It made it hard to move things around. There were not enough people to do the work. So, some things were hard to find.

The UK government said that other countries also had these problems. They said the UK was not worse than other places.

But some experts said the UK had more problems. They said it was because there were fewer workers from Europe after Brexit. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

A survey asked people if they had problems finding food and fuel. Many more people in the UK said yes, compared to people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and Denmark. Even more people in the UK had problems than in the US.

In the UK, 56% of people said they could not find some food items. Another 9% said they did not have problems, but they knew people who did.

In the US, 49% of people had trouble finding food. 10% knew someone who did.

But in Europe, fewer people had food problems. In Germany, only 18% had problems. In France, it was 16%. In Sweden, it was 12%. In Denmark, it was 8%. In Italy, it was only 7%.

Some people knew someone with food problems. In France, 13% knew someone. In Denmark and Italy, it was 8%. In Italy, 58% did not even know there were food problems.

A survey asked people about food and fuel. It showed that people in the UK had problems getting food and fuel more often. This happened more than in some countries in Europe.

The problem is about how things are moved around the world. This problem started because of the sickness. It made it hard to move things. There were not enough workers to move things. This made it hard to find some things.

The UK government said that this problem is all over the world. They said the UK is not worse than other places.

But some people who know about moving things disagree. They said the UK has more problems. This is because there are fewer workers from Europe since Brexit. Brexit is when the UK left the European Union.

"Just Eat has entered the fast grocery delivery market by partnering with Asda in its first tie-up with a supermarket in the UK. From January, Just Eat customers will be able to add a range of products to their baskets starting with five Asda stores, with the exact locations to be announced in the new year. “We live in an on-demand world,” said Andrew Kenny, the UK managing director of Just Eat. “We want to make sure we are getting our customers the food they want, when they want, when they want it.

"European markets have taken something of a fright before Christmas on Monday thanks to concerns about new restrictions to tackle the omicron variant - and Wall Street has followed their lead.

A $10bn spreadsheet error was among the reasons for a £47m Standard Chartered fine.

"The FTSE 100 is wavering around a 1.1% decline for the day - perhaps it is waiting for direction from the UK cabinet, which is about to meet. However, any leaks (or indeed official messages) are likely to come very near the end of the trading day, if not after. The Dax in Germany is down by 1.8% and France’s Cac 40 has lost 1.1%. The Stoxx 600, which combines all of the above and more, is down by 1.5%. Britain’s largest pub chain JD Wetherspoon has appointed two employees to its board in response to criticisms of its corporate governance. Four out of about 100 managers of Spoons pubs were chosen after shareholders and employees said it would “benefit from having more pub experience at board level”, the company said on Monday. Debbie Whittingham, a regional manager for the West Midlands, and Hudson Simmons, area manager for Sheffield, will join the board, while another two will be “associate employee directors”. Tim Martin, Wetherspoon’s founder and chairman, has previously lashed out at those who have criticised the company’s corporate governance in lengthy letters published on the stock market’s news service. However, he said: Pub and area managers, and other members of pub teams, have always participated in weekly decision-making meetings, which distil suggestions from the ‘front line’. The appointment of employee directors will extend this approach to board meetings and will help to preserve the culture of the company for the future. It was cautiously welcomed by the High Pay Centre, a thinktank focused on pay, corporate governance. Luke Hildyard, the High Pay Centre’s executive director, said: The perspectives workers directors can offer in terms of improvements to customer service and employee relations are obvious. The new Wetherspoons directors would have more credibility and independence if they’d been elected by colleagues rather than appointed by existing board members and it should also be remembered that boardroom representation is a complement not a substitute for full trade union rights and recognition. But this is a positive step by Wetherspoons that will benefit both workers and shareholders in the long term.

"As Andrew Sparrow points out on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog, there is not usually a cabinet meeting on a Monday, so this is an emergency coronavirus meeting. Dress codes and wine pairings have not yet been released. You can follow updates on the cabinet here: One for the central bank watchers: Germany’s new government has picked a new head of its central bank: “career central banker” Joachim Nagel. Nagel’s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, was perhaps the European Central Bank’s most prominent internal critic -arguing against the stimulus that it has used to prop up the EU economy. (All eurozone central bank heads get a place on the governing council, which sets monetary policy for the bloc.) Nagel, a former Bundesbank board member, will take over on 1 January. Reuters summarised his recent career as: A former board member of the state-owned development bank KfW Bank, Nagel currently works for the Bank for International Settlements, which is often considered the central bank of central banks. Early in his career, he was also a consultant for the SPD, the party that took over government earlier this month and will make the Bundesbank appointment one of its first decisions. Germany’s finance minister under the new coalition government, Christian Lindner, said on Monday: In view of inflation risks, the importance of a stability-oriented monetary policy is growing. He is an experienced personality who ensures continuity at the Bundesbank. The World Economic Forum at Davos has been postponed to the summer because of concerns about the coronavirus variant, it said on Monday. The event, usually held every year at the Swiss ski resort, was scheduled for 17 to 21 January 2022, but will instead happen in “early summer”. In January the World Economic Forum will instead run online meetings. Davos usually serves as an occasion for many of the world’s most powerful people from the realms of business, economics and politics to gather and pontificate about the world’s problems. However, the meeting of thousands of people from all over the world has been difficult to continue during pandemic conditions. The 2021 event was cancelled in favour of online events in the summer.","Here is the rewritten text, adjusted to CEFR A2 level:

Something important for people who watch central banks: Germany has a new leader for its central bank. His name is Joachim Nagel. He works at the central bank.

The old leader was Jens Weidmann. He often disagreed with the European Central Bank. He did not want the help for the EU economy. The European Central Bank used money to help the economy. All the leaders of central banks in Europe can vote on money rules.

Nagel used to work for the Bundesbank. He will start his job on January 1.

Reuters news says Nagel used to work for a bank called KfW Bank. Now, he works for the Bank for International Settlements. This bank is like a central bank for central banks. He also worked for the SPD party. This party is now in charge of the government.

Christian Lindner is the finance minister in Germany. He said that it is important to have money rules that are safe. Nagel is experienced and will keep the Bundesbank working well.

The meeting was planned for January 17 to 21, 2022. Now it will be in the early summer. In January, there will be online meetings instead.

Many important people go to Davos. They are from business, money, and politics. They talk about the world's problems.

It is hard to have the meeting with many people from all over the world because of the coronavirus. The meeting in 2021 was cancelled. There were online meetings in the summer instead.","Here are the news updates.

Andrew Sparrow wrote on the Guardian's blog. He said there is a special meeting today. It is about the coronavirus. Usually, the cabinet does not meet on Mondays. We do not know what people will wear or drink at the meeting yet. You can find updates about the cabinet online.

Germany has a new leader for its central bank. His name is Joachim Nagel. He has worked at central banks for a long time. The old leader was Jens Weidmann. He did not agree with the European Central Bank very often. He did not like the plan to help the EU economy. Each country in the Eurozone has a leader on the group that decides money rules. Nagel used to work for the Bundesbank. He will start his new job on January 1st.

Reuters news said that Nagel used to work for KfW Bank. Now, he works for the Bank for International Settlements. This bank is for other central banks. Early in his career, he helped the SPD party. This party is now in power. They will choose the new Bundesbank leader. This is one of their first decisions.

Christian Lindner is Germany's finance minister. He said that it is important to keep money stable because of inflation. He said Nagel is experienced and will keep the Bundesbank steady.

The World Economic Forum in Davos will not happen in January. It is now planned for the summer. This is because people are worried about the coronavirus. The meeting was supposed to be from January 17th to 21st, 2022. Now, it will be in ""early summer"".

In January, the World Economic Forum will have online meetings instead. Usually, important people meet in Davos. They talk about problems in the world. These people are from business, economics, and politics. But it is hard to have this meeting with so many people during the pandemic. The 2021 event was cancelled.

"In a statement, the event’s organisers said: Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary. The number of shoppers across British high streets fell over the weekend before Christmas, according to new data from Springboard that show people spurned city centre shopping during what should have been the biggest weekend of the year. Retail footfall was 19% down for the week ending on Saturday compared to the equivalent in 2019, Springboard said - although it was higher than December 2020, when the UK government dramatically u-turned to put in place a Christmas lockdown. Shopping centres fared particularly badly, with footfall down by 27% on 2019, but high streets were also down by a fifth on 2019. Retail parks, which are generally accessed by private car and are often open-air, performed slightly better. Weekend traffic overall fell compared to the previous weekend by 8.5% in Central London and by 6.4% in cities outside of the capital. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: The nervousness of shoppers about making in-person shopping visits inevitably meant that large city centres lost out to smaller high streets, particularly over the weekend when footfall declined from the week before in Central London and large cities outside of the capital whilst rising in market towns. There has been a bit of movement on currency markets as well this morning: sterling is down by 0.4% against the US dollar. One pound will buy $1.3195. That in itself is not a huge move, but it puts the pound perilously close to its lowest level since December 2020, when the UK was facing the prospect of belated Christmas restrictions in the hope of limiting the spread of a new coronavirus variant (a familiar tale). If it drops below $1.3165 it will mark a new low for 2021, an unusual situation considering the Bank of England only just last week shocked markets with an interest rate rise - pre-empting the Federal Reserve. However, the Fed has itself also made it clear that it will tighten the US money supply. The prospect of a series of interest rate rises next year has made the dollar more attractive to investors.","The people who planned an event said something. It is hard to have a big meeting now. This is because of the sickness going around.

They had rules to keep people safe. But the sickness spreads fast. It also makes it hard to travel. So, the meeting must wait.

Many people did not go shopping before Christmas. This happened in the UK. A group called Springboard has new information. It shows people did not shop in city centers. This should have been the busiest weekend of the year.

Shopping was down 19%. This is compared to the same week in 2019. But it was better than in December 2020. The UK government changed its mind then. They made a Christmas lockdown.

Shopping centers did very badly. Shopping there was down 27% from 2019. High streets also had fewer shoppers. They were down 20% from 2019.

Shopping parks did a little better. People can drive to them. They are often outside.

Less traffic happened on the weekend. Traffic in London went down by 8.5%. Traffic in other cities went down by 6.4%. This is compared to the weekend before.

Diane Wehrle works at Springboard. She said shoppers are worried about shopping in person. So, big city centers had fewer shoppers. Smaller high streets had more shoppers. This was especially true on the weekend. London and big cities had fewer shoppers than the week before. But market towns had more shoppers.

The money market has changed a little. The British pound is worth less. It is down 0.4% against the US dollar.

One pound is now worth $1.3195. This is not a big change. But the pound is close to its lowest price since December 2020. At that time, the UK might have had Christmas rules. This was to stop a new sickness from spreading.

If the pound goes below $1.3165, it will be the lowest price in 2021. This is strange. The Bank of England just made interest rates higher. This surprised the market. The Federal Reserve might also do this.

The Federal Reserve said it will make less money available. They might raise interest rates next year. This makes the US dollar more popular. People want to invest in it.","The people who planned the event said something. They said it is hard to have a meeting with people from all over the world now. This is because of the virus.

They had rules to keep people healthy at the meeting. But the new type of virus spreads very easily. It also makes it hard for people to travel. So, they have to move the meeting to a later time.

Many people did not go shopping in British towns before Christmas. This information comes from a group called Springboard. They said people did not shop in city centers. This was during the busiest weekend of the year.

The number of shoppers was less than in 2019. It was 19% less for the week that ended on Saturday. But it was more than in December 2020. At that time, the government changed its mind and had a Christmas lockdown.

The money market changed a little today. The British pound is worth less than before. It is down 0.4% against the American dollar.

One pound is worth $1.3195. This is not a big change. But the pound is close to its lowest value since December 2020. At that time, the UK might have had Christmas rules to stop the virus.

If the pound goes below $1.3165, it will be the lowest value for 2021. This is surprising. The Bank of England just increased interest rates last week. They did this before the American Federal Reserve.

But the Federal Reserve also said they will make less money available in the US. People think interest rates will increase next year. This makes the American dollar more attractive to people who invest money.","The people who planned an event said something.

Many stores are in areas called ""high streets"" in Britain. A company called Springboard has new information. It shows that fewer people went to these stores before Christmas. The weekend before Christmas should be the busiest time for shopping. But people did not go to the city centers to shop.

"Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the dollar will be, pace the omicron variant, one of the “winners from global growth” during 2022. There has also been a similar bounce on oil markets. The price of Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, is still down by 3.3% today - but that is a recovery from earlier. Brent crude futures were down by as much as 5% earlier this morning, with one barrel for February delivery going for as little as $69. It is now back at $71.30. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, an investing platform, said: Heavy selling has hit the oil markets again this week with WTI and Brent crude both shedding more than 3% extending losses after a week in the red with Brent already ending down 2.6% as the Omicron variant continues to spread, weighing on the demand outlook and market sentiment. The Netherlands’ latest lockdown from Sunday sparked investor concerns of fresh restrictions in Europe and the US to curb the spread of Covid, prompting fears of a near-term economic slowdown. Brent crude has shed more than 17% from the October high, trading in a descending trendline and retracing around 70% of its prior gains from the August trough. Kit Juckes, a strategist at Société Générale, a bank, is in a festive mood - albeit the wrong feast. “It’s a lot more like Halloween than Christmas,” he said: Oil prices, equity indices and bond yields are lower on a mix of omicron concerns and Senator Joe Manchin’s announcement that he won’t vote for President Biden’s spending bill. Just over half an hour after the FTSE 100 slumped further, it has just regained a percentage point. It is now down by just 1.3% at 7,179 points, having earlier dropped by as much as 2.2%. European stocks have also recovered somewhat: Germany’s Dax is now down by 2.2% and France’s Cac 40 is down 1.4%. All the usual disclaimers apply at this point in the year: a fair few investors will have shut up shop for the holidays, and few of those who remain will have planned any major moves in the absence of central bank activity.","Mark Haefele works for UBS.

"That means that there will be lower liquidity and fewer buyers to soak up any sales, so moves can be exaggerated. Nevertheless, that is a notable swing over the course of less than an hour. It may have been partly helped by vaccine maker Moderna. It said on Monday (in an interview published at 10am GMT) that a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to offer protection against the omicron variant. Reuters reported: The vaccine maker said the decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently discovered variant is spreading. The company still plans to develop a vaccine specifically to protect against Omicron, which it hopes to advance into clinical trials early next year. “What we have available right now is 1273,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer, said in an interview. “It’s highly effective, and it’s extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we’re going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.” Some detail on how the UK’s shops fared over the last week - usually one of the the strongest of the year: it was not great. Footfall on and near London’s Oxford Street, the country’s biggest shopping district, was 17% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the New West End Company, which represents about 600 shops. Shopping was 5% below the previous weekend, and across the entire week of the 13th December footfall was down by 29% compared with 2019’s figures. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said businesses were “disappointed” with how the weekend went: With less than five days to go until Christmas day and the probabilities of a circuit-breaker lockdown increasingly on the horizon, the retail and leisure sector is now facing a huge amount of financial uncertainty when it should be enjoying a much needed shot in the arm. We are therefore backing the #BusinessBooster campaign and calling on the government to provide urgent and swift financial support. Temporary measures such as a 100% business rate relief for the first quarter of the year, extension of the VAT reduction and introduction of grants could be the difference between viable businesses avoiding closures and job losses in the new year.","Okay, here is the rewritten text at a CEFR A2 level:

The market can change a lot. Sometimes there is not much money for buying and selling. If there are not many buyers, the prices can go up or down very fast.

Recently, the market changed quickly in less than one hour. This may be because of the company Moderna. Moderna makes a vaccine.

Moderna said that another dose of their vaccine can help protect people from the Omicron virus. This was said on Monday. The time was 10 am in London.

Reuters said that Moderna will use the current vaccine first. The current vaccine is called mRNA-1273. They will use this vaccine because the Omicron virus is spreading fast.

Moderna also plans to make a new vaccine for Omicron. They hope to test the new vaccine soon. This might happen early next year.

Dr. Paul Burton works for Moderna. He said the current vaccine is good. He said it is safe and works well. He thinks it will help people during the holidays. He also thinks it will help during the winter. Omicron will be a problem in the winter.

Shops in the UK did not do well last week. Usually, the week before Christmas is very good for shops. But this year, it was not good.

Oxford Street in London is a big shopping place. The number of people shopping there was less than before the virus. It was 17% less.

Shopping was also less than the week before. It was 5% less. For the whole week of December 13th, the number of people shopping was 29% less than in 2019.

Jace Tyrrell is in charge of the New West End Company. He said that shops were ""disappointed."" There are only a few days until Christmas. There is a chance that the shops will have to close again. This means that the shops may lose a lot of money. They need help now.

The New West End Company is asking the government for money. They want the government to help the shops. They suggest the government could give shops a break on taxes. They also want the government to give shops money. This could help the shops stay open and keep people working.","It looks like there is less money to buy and sell things. Also, there are not many buyers. So, when things are bought or sold, the prices can change a lot.

Something important happened in less than one hour. The company Moderna, which makes vaccines, may have helped. On Monday, they said their vaccine can protect against the Omicron virus. This was in an interview that started at 10am GMT.

Christmas is very close. There is a chance the government might close shops again. This makes it hard for shops to know what to do. They need money now, but they are not getting much.

The New West End Company supports the #BusinessBooster campaign. They want the government to give money to shops quickly.

They want the government to help in a few ways. For example, they want shops to pay less tax at the start of next year. They also want the government to give shops money. This could help shops stay open and keep people from losing their jobs in the new year.","It means there will be less money available in the market. Also, fewer people will want to buy things.

"The FTSE 100 sell-off has accelerated - it is now down by 2.2%. It has hit the lowest level since the start of December as concern over the spread of the omicron variant ramp up. While the UK government is fielding a lot of questions about parties, the hospitality industry is trying to put the pressure on over the lack of them, given how the current lockdown-lite has affected their bookings. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge writes: Pubs and restaurants have warned of plummeting sales and “decimated” bookings, as pressure increases on the government to offer urgent financial support to struggling hospitality businesses. The weekend just passed should have been the busiest trading period of the Christmas season, but customers chose to stay away, said Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of the pub and brewery chain Greene King, which runs 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. “Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, some parts of the country we are 70%, 80% down on 2019, so the situation is pretty unsustainable,” Mackenzie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday.
