"Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and rose all the way to its top but even he struggles to recall a Latin American year like 2019. “Like this? Never before,” Brazil’s former foreign minister said of the tumultuous 12 months that have seen social and political upheaval rattle the region, from Buenos Aires to Bogotá. The final year of the decade was only 23 days old when the turmoil began with an explosion of dissent on the streets of Venezuela that most observers felt sure would displace its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mass protests, frantic predictions of Maduro’s imminent downfall, and a botched military uprising followed before Juan Guaidó’s campaign to topple Hugo Chávez’s heir fizzled and an uneasy calm returned. But elsewhere the action was only just beginning, as a wave of protests and violence swept Puerto Rico, Haiti, Ecuador and Bolivia – where President Evo Morales was forced from office amid a bloody military crackdown – leaving some wondering if a Latin American Spring had arrived. In Peru the president dissolved congress; in Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner staged a dramatic political comeback; and in Colombia hundreds of thousands flooded the streets in opposition to the rightwing president, Iván Duque. Even Chile, supposedly a haven of Latin American stability and affluence, was sucked into the mayhem as a hike in subway fares triggered its worst unrest in decades, leaving a trail of destruction and President Sebastián Piñera’s future in doubt. “Where did that come from?” Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group’s Latin America chief, wondered as he considered that country’s unexpected cameo in the chaos. As a new year of uncertainty approached, Briscoe said he sensed “an acceleration of time” in the region.","Celso Amorim joined Brazil’s foreign service nearly six decades ago and climbed to the top of the world’s top, but even he can’t remember a Latin American year like 2019.

"“Things which have been building up for years and years – whether it’s the social stratification of Chile; Evo Morales’s moves towards eternal power in Bolivia; the deeply hostile standoff in Venezuela – now seem to be breaking the surface in so many different contexts and leading to a situation where we fundamentally don’t know what is going to happen. “I can tell you where I think the fault lines are going to be for next year,” he added. “But I can’t say exactly what is going to materialize.” Some on Latin America’s left have sought comfort in the confusion. Amorim, 77, painted the upheaval as a popular “counter-reaction” to the “onslaught of neoliberalism” besieging countries from Colombia to Chile. “It is very difficult to say where we’re going,” he said. “But one thing is different: eight months ago, the appearance was that everything was going rightwing – totally rightwing. And now it’s not so clear. So that – in spite of all the problems – is some kind of progress. “Latin America is in a moment of turbulence. But [for the left] turbulence is better than a death in the cemetery.” As the year draws to a close, minds are turning to what comes next. In a new report the Economist Intelligence Unit warned of a high risk of “protest contagion”, noting how Colombia’s protests were inspired by rebellions in neighbouring countries. “There is a strong chance that 2020 will be another volatile year for Latin America,” the report said, predicting particularly choppy waters in Lenín Moreno’s Ecuador. “It’s like a powder keg,” Amorim agreed. “At any moment that [country] could explode again.” Briscoe saw three likely 2020 flash points: Venezuela, as it fell deeper into political and humanitarian ruin; Brazil and Argentina, as a diplomatic spat intensified between their ideologically opposed leaders; and Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is struggling to control a historic murder crisis claiming almost 100 lives a day.","Some problems have been going on for years.

"Mass demonstrations rocked Mexico in 2014 after the disappearance of 43 students shocked the nation and Briscoe said a repeat was possible if the killing did not slow. Briscoe also foresaw strife in Bolivia if the ultra-conservative activist Luis Fernando Camacho reached the second-round of fresh presidential elections and faced a candidate from Evo Morales’s leftist Movement Towards Socialism. “I’d say we will be facing a very tricky period … In Colombia, in Chile, but also Brazil, Mexico and Argentina there is potential for things to go very wrong indeed. “We are sitting on a minefield of social discontent,” Briscoe added, identifying Honduras, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Chile as other potential “danger spots”. Observers are split on whether Latin America’s biggest economy runs the risk of unrest, with former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recently urging followers to “follow Chile’s example” and rebel against the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Some argue Bolsonaro’s shock 2018 election has helped channel anti-establishment rage away from the streets, for now. But Monica de Bolle, a Latin America expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Brazil could easily be next. “The moment right now – as of this very second – is not one where people are going to go out in the streets and demonstrate. But things are not static – things are dynamic,” she said. “I think it’s very, very likely that some time soon – and soon could be 2020 or the end of 2020 – people will realize that this is not an economy that is going to grow much because the policies are not there and the agenda doesn’t exist … [and] then Bolsonaro’s support immediately drops. “That may lead to something like we’ve seen in Brazil in the past few years and it could even be a 2013-type scenario,” she said, referring to the mass demonstrations that paved the way for Dilma Rousseff’s impeachment three years later. Amorim also predicted his country could face tumult as public anger at Bolsonaro’s failings grew.","Masses rocked Mexico in 2014, after 43 students disappeared, which shocked the nation.

"Protesters in Iraq have dealt a symbolic blow to US prestige by storming the American embassy in Baghdad, trapping diplomats inside while chanting “Death to America” and slogans in support of pro-Iranian militias. In a humiliating day for Washington, hundreds of demonstrators besieged the US compound, at one point breaching the main gate and smashing their way into several reception rooms. They lit fires, battered down doors, and lobbed bricks at bulletproof glass. The rampage was carried out with the apparent connivance of Iraqi security forces who allowed protesters inside the highly protected Green Zone. They made their way to the embassy, climbing walls and hurling stones. US guards responded with tear gas but did not open fire. Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the day-long attack, which followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured. US officials said the raids were carried out to deter future acts of aggression following a rocket attack on Friday by the group against a US base in Kirkuk, in which one US contractor was killed and four Americans were injured. President Trump approved the operation on Saturday. Instead of advancing US goals, the airstrikes appear to be the latest in a series of foreign policy blunders in the Middle East. Iraq’s government furiously condemned them, while pro-Iranian militias promised further attacks against American targets, with the goal of expelling US forces. “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.” The US embassy denied earlier reports from Iraq’s foreign ministry that the ambassador and his staff were hastily evacuated, as protesters surged towards the building.

"The embassy was under lockdown but had not been evacuated, the spokesperson said, with diplomats sheltering in a safe-room.

Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. Nonetheless, the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq looms large. The Trump administration’s policy of piling sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran appears to have brought about few tangible diplomatic results and has taken relations with Iraq to a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – vowed on Tuesday to protect the safety and security of US personnel. After doing little initially to halt the violence Iraqi security forces turned up in force in the afternoon, and formed a protective line between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said the US would “protect and defend its people” in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The viability of the US’s diplomatic mission in Baghdad – its largest in the world – is now an open question, as demonstrators set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters.

During that raid, 52 US citizens were taken hostage. Tuesday’s events, however, were not on the same dramatic scale. There was no loss of life and most of the embassy building survived intact. But the prospect of a worsening conflict between US forces and Iranian proxies in Iraq is big. The Trump administration imposed sanctions and economic pressure on Tehran. This policy has not been very good. It has also taken relations with Iraq down a new low. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and Washington – said on Tuesday that he would protect the safety and security of US personnel. Iraqi security forces did little to stop the violence. They came in force in the afternoon. They were a line. This line was between angry crowds and US guards. The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the US would ""protect and defend its people"" in a phone call with Abdul-Mahdi. The US's diplomatic mission in Baghdad is the largest in the world. It's now a question of its viability. Demonstrators have set up tents outside its perimeter. Many of the protesters had come from funerals held in Baghdad for some of the dead militia fighters. They were carrying flags. The flags were Kata'ib Hezbollah and Hashd al-Shaabi. Hashd al-Shaabi is also called the Popular Mobilization Forces. It's a powerful paramilitary group. Kata'ib Hezbollah is part of this group."

"A magnitude-5.1 earthquake has struck near Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake was moderate, which can cause considerable damage, and was centred 53km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, a nuclear facility on Iran’s southern coast of the Persian Gulf. The quake struck at 5.23am local time (0153GMT), at the relatively shallow depth of 38km. There were no immediate reports of damage, Iranian state television reported. “No reports have been received on any possible damage from the earthquake,” it said. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was designed to withstand much stronger earthquakes. “No damage has been reported to us so far based on the checks by the Red Crescent Society, village councillors and officials in the area,” Jahangir Dehqan, the head of the provincial emergency department, told the semi-official news agency ISNA. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn’t damaged at that time. In 2019 Iran announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal after Donald Trump pulled the US out last year. Tehran says its nuclear programme is entirely for civil nuclear purposes.","A magnitude-5. 1 earthquake has hit near Iran’s Bushehr nuclear plant on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey.

"Bred by an emperor and nearly killed off by communists, the Hungarian mangalica pig has been through a lot during its nearly two centuries of existence. A lumbering, chunky beast with a sheep-like coat, it is the hairiest and fattiest of pigs. And according to its many fans, the mangalica is also one of the tastiest. From being on the verge of extinction three decades ago, the mangalica has made a remarkable comeback to the farms, tables and hearts of Hungarians over the past decade, and has recently been taking the global fine-dining scene by storm from the US to Japan, where its fatty, marbled texture has led it to be nicknamed “Kobe pork”. In Hungary, the breed has been officially registered as one of the country’s national treasures. However, the pride of Hungarian agriculture is now facing another threat: the epidemic of African swine fever sweeping through eastern Europe, which has led to a number of culls. The growing popularity of mangalica is also causing disputes with Hungary’s neighbours. There was a furious reaction earlier this month when a popular US gastro-blogger introduced mangalica as a “medieval Romanian food” in a video that garnered nearly a million views on YouTube. Simmering tension remains over Hungary’s historical role as ruler of part of the country’s territory, and the Hungarian press was outraged. “It was not enough that they took away Transylvania, trying to expropriate our culture and our historical memories … Now they also want to steal mangalica from us,” wrote the rightwing news portal 888.hu. “It can become like hummus is for Lebanon and Israel,” said Péter Tóth, the president of Hungary’s Mangalica Breeders Association, in an interview at an upmarket Budapest restaurant over a plate of mangalica ham cuts.

"The breed was created in the 1830s after the Habsburg emperor in Vienna was gifted 11 fatty, long-haired pigs by the prince of Serbia and had them cross-bred with some old Hungarian breeds near Arad, now part of Romania. At one point, 90% of all pigs in Hungary were mangalica, with the high fat content prized because the copious lard could be stored for much longer than meat. With the onset of electricity and refrigeration, production declined and it became more of a luxury product. After the second world war, the communist system almost destroyed the mangalica; only about 300 sows were maintained in reservations for scientific purposes. The meat was nowhere to be found. As a young veterinary student in Spain in the early 1990s, Tóth told a Spanish friend about the fatty Hungarian pigs and the pair launched a project to save the mangalica. “I put adverts in local newspapers: ‘If you’ve seen a mangalica, please let me know,’” he recalled. He bought up the whole population and for several years bred them with Spanish investment, until they were ready to send fatty pork for curing in Spain by the late 90s. There are now more than 200 mangalica farmers in Hungary and the meat is on sale in almost every marketplace, at prices about four times higher than normal pork. Zsóka Fekete, who runs a mangalica farm in eastern Hungary, said: “It’s different from any other meat. The texture is marbled, especially in the neck. It’s a completely unique taste.” She worked in a multinational company in Budapest before deciding in 2012 to return to her family farm and buy 20 mangalica sows, which she has since grown to 300. She has a loyal client base including Michelin-starred restaurants and Budapest mangalica lovers, who form queues to buy her produce when she makes the trip to the capital once a fortnight. Indeed, the only blip on the horizon for the mangalica is the African swine fever epidemic.","The breed was created in the 1830s.

"The first cases were detected in Hungary’s wild boar population last April, and while no domesticated pigs have yet caught the virus, due to its extreme contagiousness, any time a diseased boar carcass is found, all pigs within a two-mile (3km) radius must be culled. It is particularly dangerous for the mangalica, which live in semi-open conditions, and new security measures have been put in place, including double fencing and a ban on visitors to farms. So far, about 1,200 mangalica have been slaughtered across Hungary, more than 10% of the population. Tóth said the government had recently approved a special strategy to save the mangalica should the situation become critical: an emergency gene-banking system will be set up, and the most valuable mangalica specimens will be moved to safe spaces such as zoos or universities. As for climate concerns around meat consumption, it is likely to be a while before that affects sales in Hungary, where pork is ubiquitous and vegetarianism still seen as quirky eccentricity. But Tóth, surprisingly, advocates for his compatriots to eat less meat. “I am against the low quality and the animal suffering involved in industrially farmed meat,” he said, skewering a fatty slice of mangalica jamon with a fork. “Humans should eat less meat, for sure. But when they do, it should be high quality. For example, one piece of mangalica per week.”","The first cases were found in Hungary's wild boar population last April.

"The protests erupting all over India about the changes to citizenship embodied in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are heartwarming because they tell us that Indian democracy is alive and well at its grassroots, despite its current parliamentarians having ridden roughshod over the constitution (Jails fill amid rage on the streets, 21 December). This constitution was carefully debated and crafted in the constituent assembly over a three-year period as its makers, trained in the art of nationalist resistance, wrested control from the colonial state in an extraordinary exercise of moral and political legitimacy that laid bare the nature of British colonialism. In Henry Maine’s words, British India was a “most extraordinary experiment” involving “the virtually despotic government of a dependency by a free people”. The postcolonial state of India that emerged in 1947, despite the bloody internecine conflict at its birth, did fulfil its promise at some level, to its citizens of “a sovereign, socialist and democratic republic” with justice, liberty and equality to all for the next 70 years. The constitutional imbroglio that India is in today is a result of a hasty and communally motivated act that goes against the vision of the architects of this great and diverse nation and its remarkable constitution. Vinita Damodaran Professor of south Asian history, University of Sussex • Re your report (Canada police prepared to shoot Indigenous activists, documents show, 20 December), yes this is awful, and I appreciate you sharing it. However, I would love it if you would start including the responsibility of England for the colonialism here in Canada, starting with Rupert’s Land, which was appropriated with the stroke of a pen in 1670 – which led to the extraction of this region through the Hudson Bay Company. Absolutely everything about the way Canada is now started in England. England has benefited enormously from colonialism in Canada.

"Food The rancour over Brexit has been cruel to the restaurant sector. A weakening pound has made ingredients more expensive, while mixed messages on residency rights for EU citizens has caused myriad problems for the workforce, particularly front of house. Although we now have certainty, and will leave at the end of January, none of that seems likely to improve in 2020. Indeed, anecdotally, restaurateurs and chefs are reporting that it’s harder than ever to retain non-UK staff, who quite reasonably question whether they have a future here. There’s a similar problem in the food processing sector, parts of which have historically been dominated by eastern European labour. Difficulties retaining staff usually lead to salary increases to encourage them to stay, and that cost has to be passed on to the consumer. Expect price rises across the hospitality and food industries in the coming year. At the end of 2019, the journal Lancet Planetary Health published a letter from a global group of scientists concerned about the climate crisis, calling on nations to declare a timeframe for peak livestock production, after which point it will no longer increase. There has already been movement away from meat consumption on the high street, with the arrival of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. In the coming year we will see an ever-greater acceleration towards vegetarian and vegan cookery. Expect to see more high street brands increase the scope of their non-meat menu options. As to culinary trends, there are signs that the food traditions of Africa may finally get a look in, at least in London. After a bunch of well received pop-ups, a permanent home for Chuku’s, a restaurant in Tottenham specialising in the food of Nigeria, will be launched in February. Around the same time, William JM Chilila, a finalist last year on MasterChef: The Professionals, will open the west African influenced Akoko in Fitzrovia. Jay Rayner Three to watch Nisha Katona She is a former barrister who gave it all up to explore her family’s Indian heritage through the home cooking she knows so well at her Indian café, Mowgli. What started as a single restaurant in her home town of Liverpool has become a 10-strong group, with at least four more due to open in 2020, and leases are sorted on the same number again.","Food The Brexit row has been cruel to the restaurant industry.

"Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain in the hope of making a splash. He holds three Michelin stars at Eleven Madison Park in New York and has just opened at Claridge’s Hotel in Mayfair, in the space most recently occupied by Simon Rogan’s Fera and before that, by Gordon Ramsay. Neither quite managed to make a raging success of that space. Humm will be hoping Davies and Brook, named after the two streets upon which Claridge’s sits, will do the business. Will Beckett and Huw Gott It’s only fair to point out that it works both ways. In March, the team behind the highly regarded Hawksmoor group make their most audacious move yet: they’re opening a steakhouse in New York, long regarded as the go-to city for a good steak. Finding out what New Yorkers make of the British take on the steak should be very interesting indeed. Climate Next year, politicians will get a final chance to try to limit the climate crisis that threatens to envelop the world. On 9 November, delegates will meet at the UN COP26 talks in Glasgow to attempt to agree on carbon emission reductions that could keep global temperature rises to well below 2C. Scientists have warned that the world has already warmed by 1.1C since pre-industrial times and that this figure could reach 3C to 4C by the end of this century. Increasingly violent storms, rising sea levels, spreading deserts, crop failures and deadly heatwaves would threaten lives globally. For most of 2020, diplomatic efforts will be made to prepare for the Glasgow talks with the aim of getting nations to commit to significant reductions in carbon emissions and to narrow the gulf between the developing and developed world over the fight against the climate crisis. Developing countries say the industrialised world is largely responsible for most carbon emissions to date but are still not doing enough to make reductions. They are also demanding that rich nations provide at least $100bn annually to help them mitigate the worst impacts of global heating and to cut emissions. Efforts to reconcile the two sides have so far failed.","Daniel Humm He is the latest in a long line of American chefs who have come to Britain to try something new.

"Greenland is losing its ice sheet seven times faster than it was in the 1990s, and the west Antarctic ice sheet is now destabilising dangerously – threatening sea-level rises that will be devastating in low-lying Bangladesh and Pacific islands in the near future.

"Vanessa Thorpe Three to watch Johnny Flynn Already familiar to fans of the 2018 TV series of Les Miserables and Vanity Fair, the actor will have a big year. He appears as Bowie in Stardust and as a blond (shock) Knightley in a film of Jane Austen’s Emma, alongside Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart. Another Brit film The Dig, about an archaeologist, is also due to put him up on the big screen soon. Nicky Morgan The reappointed culture secretary, now operating from the elevated calm of the House of Lords, will receive pleas from all manner of cash-starved arts schemes, venues and institutes. Will she stay in the job for the long term, and, if so, will she listen? Adele Rumours about the release date for her putative fourth album (30?) are likely to reach fever pitch after a turbulent few years out of the limelight. Royals After a stormy year, the royal family face a challenging 2020 to steady the good ship Monarchy. The Queen, who will be 94 in April, looks increasingly alone as the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 99 in June, leads a near solitary life on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Decisions by some family members have raised questions over how much the Queen is consulted by others who may be keen to pursue their own agendas. Prince Andrew’s astonishing TV interview with Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis, may have put Pizza Express, Woking, on the map and had a nation googling medical conditions that prevent sweating, but any hopes that it would dampen the burning debate over his relationship with the disgraced late US financier Jeffrey Epstein are badly misplaced. With Epstein’s alleged victims’ lawyers’ relentless efforts to drag the prince into their legal battle in the US, this long saga looks set to continue, despite Andrew stepping back from public life for the foreseeable future. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, meanwhile, are pursuing their own legal actions as part of a bold and risky strategy in taking on the press over privacy. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter to her estranged father.","Vanessa Thorpe Three to watch Johnny Flynn Already familiar to fans of the 2018 TV series Les Miserables and Vanity Fair, the actor will have a big year.

"The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels, and warned that assets in the sector could end up “worthless”. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme being broadcast on Monday, Carney said that although the financial sector was starting to cut back on investment in oil and gas companies, the process was not moving quickly enough. Carney, who will focus on his new role as UN special envoy for climate change and finance after he steps down from the governorship in the new year, agreed to appear on the programme for an edition edited by the climate crisis campaigner Greta Thunberg, one of several guest editors on Today over the holiday period. Carney has been one of the most vocal central bank governors on the need for the financial sector to do more to transition towards a zero-carbon economy. He told the programme that the climate crisis was a “tragedy on the horizon” and that more extreme weather events were inevitable. “By the time that the extreme events become so prevalent and so obvious, it will be too late to do anything about it,” he said. Political leaders had to “start addressing future problems today”. On the issue of whether investors should be divesting from companies in the fossil fuel sector, Carney said fund managers would “have to make the judgment and justify to the people whose money it ultimately is”. When pressed on whether pension funds should divest from oil and gas companies even if the returns were attractive, he replied: “Well that hasn’t been the case but they could make that argument. They need to make the argument, to be clear about why is that going to be the case if a substantial proportion of those assets are going to be worthless.” He warned: “If we were to burn all those oil and gases, there’s no way we would meet carbon budgets. Up to 80% of coal assets will be stranded, [and] up to half of developed oil reserves. A question for every company, every financial institution, every asset manager, pension fund or insurer: what’s your plan?” The Bank of England has said assets worth up to $20tn (£16tn) could become worthless very quickly if the financial sector and business do not make a smooth transition towards a zero-carbon economy.","The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said all companies and financial institutions must justify their continued investment in fossil fuels and warned that assets in the sector could be ""worthless"".

"A man who was shot dead in central Moscow after opening fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia’s main intelligence agency building, in an attack that killed two has been identified as a gun enthusiast. Investigators named him as Yevgeny Manyurov, 39, from Podolsk, a small town some 30 miles south of Moscow. One FSB employee was killed as Manyurov opened fire with an automatic weapon on Thursday evening, spraying the windows of the intelligence agency’s Lubyanka headquarters with bullets from the street outside. A second FSB officer died in hospital of his injuries on Friday evening. One more FSB officer was critically wounded, while three people, including a civilian, had less serious injuries. Manyurov was then shot dead by an FSB sniper, officials said. Officers discovered grenades and an improvised explosive device in a rucksack he was carrying. Security officials said Manyurov had not managed to enter the Lubyanka building, which previously housed the main offices of the KGB, the Soviet-era secret police. Russian media have portrayed the gunman, who lived with his mother, as a loner obsessed with firearms. He was unemployed, but had previously worked as a security guard, including at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in Moscow, his father told Russian media. Manyurov recently came third in a shooting competition staged by a Soviet-era patriotic paramilitary sports group that was revived by Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in 2009. Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich, an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club where Manyurov practised, said he was a “poor shot” who used to arrive at the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with a hood up. “We advised him to take off his coat during shooting sessions, but he said he felt comfortable in it,” Solovich told Russia’s Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.","A man opened fire on the offices of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in central Moscow.

Police reportedly seized a small arsenal of legally owned weapons, including two semi-automatic rifles and two shotguns from his home. He is reported to have used a Kalashnikov assault rifle during Thursday’s attack. Oleg Solovich was an instructor at the Dosaaf shooting club. Manyurov did there. Solovich said he was a ""poor shot."" He used to come to the firing range in a long black Parka raincoat with the hood up."
"The motive for the attack remains unclear, although Kommersant, a daily newspaper, reported that witnesses told investigators he was shouting slogans “typical of Islamic State”. “I noticed he had been somewhat agitated lately,” Baza, a media outlet with links to the security services, cited his mother as saying. She said he was unmarried, with no children or close friends, and that he was passionate about guns. He appears to have had no social media presence. The assault on the FSB office took place shortly after Putin’s annual press conference in Moscow. The president was attending a gala concert at the nearby Kremlin in honour of the security services during the shootout. The attack may have been planned to coincide with the speech, an FSB source told Reuters. Meduza, an independent news website, said that police may have continued firing for some time after Manyurov was killed, possibly injuring a passerby in the process.","The motive for the attack is still unclear.

"Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend. As junior coalition partners of the Austrian People’s party (ÖVP), the Greens would take the place of the far-right Freedom party, whose leadership resigned in disgrace over the “Ibiza affair” corruption scandal in May, and which was duly punished by voters in ensuing elections. Kurz’s ÖVP and the Greens were the big winners in the September vote, the former coming top with 37% and the latter achieving the best result in its history. After months of protracted coalition talks, the parties reached an agreement on Saturday, with Kurz telling reporters: “I’m very optimistic about the possibility of forming a government with the Greens.” “We have overcome some seemingly insurmountable hurdles”, said the Green leader, Werner Kogler, who is likely to be made deputy chancellor. If the Austrian Green party’s 276 delegates formally approve the coalition deal this Saturday, the president, Alexander Van der Bellen, could swear in a new government as soon as 7 January. The power-sharing deal will be watched with great interest by Austria’s neighbours: in Switzerland, the Greens made historic gains in October elections and have called for reform of the country’s “magic formula” power-sharing arrangement to give the ecological party a bigger say. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU and the Green party lead the polls, with the next federal elections scheduled for autumn 2021. “Something is happening in our neighbouring country that citizens here can only dream of,” wrote the conservative German daily Die Welt. “A fresh start into a new political era, shaped by two pro-European parties that emerged as clear winners from recent elections”. The power balance in Austria’s new government is likely to reflect Kurz’s commanding victory in September. The ÖVP is expected to retain control of the key posts of chancellor and finance minister, while also claiming the interior, foreign and defence ministries. A new ministry for integration looks designated to allow Kurz to continue his hardline policy on immigration.","Austria’s Green party is on the verge of entering government for the first time after the environmentalists and the conservative party of former and likely new chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed to a preliminary coalition deal over the weekend.

"Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce. Hundreds of trade unionists and strikers gathered on Monday morning outside Gare de Lyon, which is used by large numbers of passengers travelling south for the holidays or to ski resorts near the Alps, and where many services have been cancelled. Some strikers made speeches denouncing the government’s proposed changes to the pension system and vowed to continue their stoppages into Christmas and the new year. Protesters let off flares and fireworks, and smoke drifted down into the station concourse. Riot police with helmets and shields were positioned at ticket barriers. The nationwide transport strikes have been going on for 19 days, causing what the state rail operator SNCF called “ongoing severe disruption” to services. A majority of trade unions and grassroots rail workers ignored the French president’s plea for a Christmas pause as passengers queued at ticket offices to find seats on the few trains running. Some train routes were cut short and some services were replaced by coaches. About 48% of ticket holders had their high-speed and intercity services cancelled on 23 and 24 December, leaving many to scramble for car-share schemes or last-minute vehicle hire. Severe disruption continued on the Paris métro and local trains in the region around the capital. Large crowds gathering at Gare du Nord for the reduced trains to the suburbs. Some passengers trying to reach airports near Paris complained that taxis were hard to find and certain drivers were charging higher than usual prices – exceeding the standard flat fee – because the traffic jams on the Paris ring road were so long. Others expressed concerns about how they would return at the end of the Christmas holidays, with strikes due to continue into January. Meanwhile, a production shutdown was under way at Lavera oil refinery in southern France, which processes 210,000 barrels per day, after workers represented by the CGT union voted to stop output as part of the protests over pension changes. CGT union workers also voted to halt production at Total’s Grandpuits refinery.","Striking French rail workers have clashed with riot police in Paris after holding a demonstration against pension changes despite Emmanuel Macron’s call for a Christmas truce.

"Emmanuel Lepine, the secretary general of the CGT’s oil branch, told France Info radio that CGT workers at other refineries in France could also vote to halt production. “We gave an ultimatum to the government, it didn’t listen, so we’re doing exactly what we promised,” Lepine said. “What we are demanding is the withdrawal of the reform.” State officials have begun preparing for another round of union negotiations in the coming weeks before a further national day of protests on 9 January.

"As the world ushers in 2021, many will be looking forward to putting 2020 behind them. From a cocktail-making contest to a MasterChef-inspired cook-off, the Guardian spoke to four people about their plans for New Year’s Eve. ‘I think he’s making a daiquiri but he’s not very good’ “I’ll be making a raspberry mojito,” said Elinor, speaking of the cocktail-making contest she and her partner, Richard, both 32, have planned for Thursday night. “I think he’s making a daiquiri, but he’s not very good,” she added. Elinor, who works as an engineer in Glasgow, said the idea came to them as they drew suggestions from a hat. Both of them will also be attending an organised online murder mystery event. “We’ve done one before and they work quite well – you go into Zoom rooms to be questioned then come back together and watch the scenes play out,” she said. “In Scotland we have a tradition to ‘first foot’, which means being someone’s first visitor after midnight – normally bearing gifts such as shortbread and whisky. You’re not supposed to cross your threshold to leave your house until you get your first foot [visitor], but with Covid I do worry how some people will balance their superstitions.” The last two years both of them had norovirus, so this year is seen as an “improvement”. “We would normally have drinks at a friend’s house, but we just hope we can stop the number of people getting sick. It’s horrifying at the moment.” ‘We’ve got to be optimistic’ In Preston, Janet and her husband, now both retired, have got together with neighbours every year for the last 18 years for a Christmas party. Coronavirus has prevented them celebrating this year but they are determined to see in 2021 together.

It’s been a bit disappointing since I arrived in the UK as you always hear that London has a lot of cultural things to offer, but I’ve not been able to experience that yet.

"In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty. In New York, Times Square was mostly deserted. No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. With revelry around the world curtailed by lockdowns and curfews imposed to stem the spread of Covid-19, the lions of London’s Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, and there were no crowds in St Peter’s Square and no one diving into the Tiber in Rome. This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other as many people bid farewell to a year they would much prefer to forget – one that has seen more than 1.7 million people killed and 82 million infected by the coronavirus since January. Sydney, whose pyrotechnic display has in the past drawn crowds of a million people to the city’s harbour area, rang in 2021 with a shortened display, with most popular observation spots fenced off and a heavy police presence deterring visitors. Only people who had restaurant reservations or were one of five guests of an inner-city resident were allowed in. “What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands gathered at popular spots across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but were not particularly worried. In New Zealand, too, which has managed to eliminate coronavirus after a strict seven-week lockdown, New Year’s Eve plans proceeded as usual. In Germany, however, where the sale of fireworks has been banned to discourage crowds and authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”, Angela Merkel said in her 16th and final new year’s address as chancellor that she had never found the old year so heavy.","In Sydney the fireworks soared into the sky above the Opera House, but the harbour below was empty.

"“And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope,” said Merkel, a trained physicist who won praise for taming the first virus wave but has drawn criticism for soaring infection and death numbers in the second. She condemned anti-lockdown protesters and vaccine conspiracy theorists. “I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona, or having to fight against the repercussions of an illness, when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” Merkel said. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the country to have the “quietest New Year’s Eve” in living memory. No more than six adults will be allowed to gather around the dinner table in France, where 100,000 police and gendarmes will clamp down on any public celebrations. Alcohol sales were banned in some areas and the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, ordered officers to strictly enforce a national 8pm to 6am curfew as part of a “fight against unauthorised public gatherings and the phenomenon of urban violence”. In Britain, which reported 964 deaths on Thursday amid a surge related to a new Covid variant, people planning to celebrate New Year’s Eve were warned they must leave the parties for later in 2021 as “Covid loves a crowd”. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said staying at home and seeing in 2021 “within the rules” would reduce infections and relieve pressure on hospitals. “It’s absolutely vital that this year, everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also urged people to follow the rules and “see in the new year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square. In Italy, the European country which has recorded the most Covid-19 deaths, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a 10am to 7pm curfew was in place for New Year’s Eve.","Merkel is a physicist.

"Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in his New Year’s speech on Thursday that he hoped Russians would unite in the face of the country’s battle with the virus, acknowledging a second wave of infections was still battering the country. “Unfortunately the epidemic has not yet been completely stopped,” Putin said in an address to to be broadcast just before midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. “The fight against it does not stop for a minute,” he said, adding that many medical workers would be “on duty this festive night” and calling for responsibility.

Citing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, police closed the square to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight on Wednesday and said they would disperse any onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” - the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” police chief Terence Monahan said.","Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said.

"It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. As the pandemic hit in March, the country imposed a strict nationwide lockdown, and the sanctuary’s dozens of elephants could no longer take their 30-mile daily walks, vital for stretching their legs and aiding digestion. Health problems began to set in, worsened by a glum mood that beset human and other animal inhabitants of the sanctuary. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many became depressed because they were no longer getting exercise and entertainment from the tourists who used to walk with them, wash them, play with them and take beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even greater concerns since he relied solely on the income and donations generated by tourists. Elephants will eat up to 200kg of food a day, amounting to 10% of their body weight, and it costs up to 5,000 rupees daily (£51) for each animal. “We did not want to let the elephants suffer at all, they only deserve love and respect, so we have taken loans to cover the food costs,” said Pareek, who has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have long highlighted how the training of captive elephants for tourism is cruel and abusive. In countries such as India and Thailand, where elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and booming industry, the absence of tourists has created a new animal welfare crisis. However, activists are hoping that this interruption will finally bring an end to this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found they had been tied up all day for months with limited food and water as the pandemic hit, causing lethal health complications. Varda Mehrotra, the executive director of FIAPO, said: “For years, we’ve been documenting how bad the conditions are for India’s captive elephants.","It has been a tough year for many, and for the elephants at Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, it has been no exception. The pandemic hit in March. The country locked down all the cities. The dozens of elephants could no longer walk. These 30 miles walks were important for stretching their legs and helping them digest. The people and animals in the sanctuary became gloomy. This made their health problems start and get worse. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could sense the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many were sad. They were not getting exercise and entertainment from tourists. The tourists used to walk with them, wash them and play with them. The tourists also took beautiful selfies with them. We were very worried for the elephants.” But Pareek had even more worries because he relied only on the income and donations from tourists. Elephants can eat 200kg of food every day. This is 10% of their body weight. Feeding one elephant costs up to 5,000 rupees a day. That's about £51. Pareek has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. He said they didn't want the elephants to suffer. Elephants only deserve love and respect. So they have borrowed money to cover the food costs. “But if foreign tourists do not come back soon it is very bad for us.” Animal rights activists have highlighted the training of captive elephants.

The pandemic hit in March. The country locked down all the cities. The elephants could no longer walk 30 miles a day. These walks were important for stretching their legs and helping them digest. The inhabitants' health started to fail. Their sad mood made it worse. This happened to both the people and the animals. Ankit Pareek, who runs the Elefanjoy sanctuary, said: “The elephants could feel the stressed and anxious feelings of the humans. Many were sad. They didn't get exercise and entertainment from the tourists. The tourists used to walk with them, wash them and play with them. The tourists also took beautiful selfies with them. We were worried for the elephants."" But Pareek had even more worries because he relied only on the income and donations from tourists. Elephants can eat up to 200kg of food a day. This is 10% of their body weight. Feeding one elephant costs up to 5,000 rupees a day. That's about £51. Pareek has lived and worked with elephants since he was a child. He said they didn't want the elephants to suffer. Elephants only deserve love and respect. So they borrowed money to pay for the food. ""But if foreign tourists don't come back soon it's very bad for us."" Animal rights activists have highlighted the training of captive elephants. Elephant tourism is usually a lucrative and lucrative industry in countries like India and Thailand. But the absence of tourists has now created a new crisis. This is a crisis for animal welfare. But activists hope this will finally end this animal exploitation through tourism. In September four elephants, trained to carry tourists on rides up to Jaipur’s Amer Fort, died. The Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) found a finding. The animals had been tied up all day for months. They had little food and water.

"Covid has exacerbated all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying.” A big issue, Mehrotra said, was that there were only about eight elephant sanctuaries in India, and most did not have the capacity to take any of the elephants now “out of work” and going hungry. Many of India’s 1,800 privately owned elephants generate income and donations through their roles in Hindu festival rituals, known as pujas, or through wedding processions, all of which remain banned due to pandemic restrictions. The governments of Kerala and Rajasthan gave small amounts of financial aid to elephant owners during lockdown, but those payments have since ceased, while other states gave nothing at all. Hareshbabu Rengan, 37, whose family in Tamil Nadu owns two 40-year-old elephants, Lakshmi and Kusma, has resorted to social media videos and a crowdfunding page to try to raise money for both his elephants and others who are struggling. “I am very worried about elephants across India,” he said. “Nobody wants to openly say that they are struggling to look after their elephants and need some funding, because they are worried about being victimised.” In Thailand, where 2,000 elephants have been held in tourist camps, the captive animals are now regularly abandoned. While the government offered some assistance, distributing emergency supplies of grass and hay earlier in the year, some camps had no option but to close. An elephant exodus across Thailand followed, with about 1,000 animals walking for days back to the villages of their mahouts, often also their birthplaces, places they had not seen in decades. In March, three female elephants, Suparp, Dok Mai, and Hong Fah, arrived at Sangdeaun Chailert’s Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai. Their handler asked to stay for a short time at Sangdeaun’s sanctuary. By the morning he had gone. Later, he called to explain he simply did not have the resources to care for the animals. “It is like when people bring the dog to the clinic, and then leave it with us. I thought this would only [happen] with a dog or cat. Now they are leaving elephants with us,” said Sangdeaun.","Covid has destroyed all the problems we’ve been raising for years and now elephants are dying."" Mehrotra said there was a big problem.

"Her centre has 97 elephants, mostly older, “retired”, animals rescued from riding and trekking camps. The crisis has caused the price of elephants in Thailand to more than halve, according to Sangdeaun. WWhile a year ago a baby elephant might have cost $100,000, now the same animal could be sold for $40,000. She worried that elephants would be no longer be kept by the families who had looked after them for generations – that they would be sold off cheaply to big companies. For elephants remaining in Thailand’s camps, it is a life in chains for long periods. “They are depressed and they get so frustrated and they attack each other,” said Sangdeaun. Some camps have reduced the number of mahouts, so there are fewer people attending the elephants’ needs.

Nonetheless, for the hundreds of elephants who have returned home with their mahouts, the coronavirus pandemic may have provided the chance to frolic in the jungles and rivers of their birth.

"The hypothesis that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples. The variant, named B117, was discovered during an investigation into why coronavirus cases in Kent continued to rise during the November lockdown. Scientists found it continued to spread during the restrictions while older variants declined. Some of the lighthouse laboratories created in April to boost Covid-19 testing capacity in places such as London and Manchester were beginning to see evidence of the new variant in respiratory samples when the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium sounded the alarm about B117 and its transmission advantage. Dr Michael Kidd, of the PHE Public Health Laboratory in Birmingham, and his team analysed a total of 641 samples based on tests from symptomatic patients and found evidence of B117 among other variants. About 35% of patients infected by B117 had high levels of the virus in their samples, compared with 10% of patients without the variant, they said in their still-to-be-peer reviewed study. “It does seem as though the patients with this variant have higher viral loads – then the obvious thing is it is easier for them to spread it to other people,” Kidd said, cautioning that the data was preliminary and more evidence needed to be collected before firm conclusions could be drawn. Scientists say they have high confidence that B117 has a transmission advantage – a modelling study by London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine researchers has estimated it is about 56% more transmissible than previous variants. A plethora of factors could explain why it is more transmissible. If the variant is more infectious, then fewer virus particles are needed in the host to pass the pathogen on. The virus might also replicate faster in the airways, or make people infectious for longer, making them more likely to transmit the virus. “Exactly how it [the variant] reaches a high viral load is another big question,” said Kidd, adding that laboratory-based confirmation is required to understand the biological basis of the transmission advantage.","The theory that the fast-spreading UK variant of the Covid-19 virus has a transmission advantage has been bolstered by an analysis that suggests it is linked to higher loads of the virus in respiratory samples.

"“Like pieces in a jigsaw we need other evidence and I think the importance of this study is – although it’s preliminary and needs repeating – it does offer a sort of on the ground explanation of why this virus may have the ability to spread more easily – because patients are more infectious.” Early data suggests the UK variant does not make people sicker or increase the likelihood of reinfection or death.

"Hospitals could soon face “horrendous choices” about which Covid-19 patients receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so dangerously overloaded, doctors fear. The warning came as calls grew for the whole of the UK to be put into a new lockdown, and for a delayed return for schools after the Christmas holidays by up to a month to help stem the massive rise in coronavirus infections. The health service is struggling to cope with record numbers of Covid cases to such an extent that some patients may be denied access to an intensive care unit or the chance to go on a mechanical ventilator, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) said on Tuesday. Pressure for a toughening of the government’s tactics against Covid comes as Matt Hancock prepares to update MPs on Wednesday about how well the tiers system of restrictions on everyday life in England are helping to contain the disease’s resurgence. The health secretary may announce the creation of a new tier 5 in England – which would be tougher than tier 4, the category London and much of southern England are already in – and put areas now in tier 3 into tier 4 in an effort to halt the rapid escalation in infections, which on Tuesday hit a new record of 53,135. Scotland already has a five-tier system. Increasing numbers of hospitals are moving closer to being overwhelmed by the number of patients needing emergency care because of Covid. In a stark illustration of the growing crisis, some ICUs in London – which is once again the worst affected part of England – are now so overloaded that doctors have asked for some patients to be transferred hundreds of miles away to Yorkshire to get a bed and help reduce the pressure on their services, the Health Service Journal reported. In another vivid example the Royal Free hospital in London is planning to move its children’s inpatient facilities to another hospital so it can use the space freed up to house adults suffering from Covid and non-Covid illnesses. It has also decided to turn the acute admissions unit at Barnet general hospital, which it runs, into extra capacity for Covid, staff were told in an email on Tuesday.","Hospitals could soon face ""horrendous choices"" about which Covid-19 patients will receive potentially life-saving treatment because the NHS is so overloaded, doctors fear.

The committee, headed by the government’s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, also said schools should remain shut until the start of February because their planned reopening from next week risked worsening the already fast-deteriorating situation, especially given the new variant that has emerged that is more transmissable and appears to be more readily infect under-18s. “Things are as bad as they have ever been. The frightening thing is that they are going to continue to get worse. Action is needed now to avoid the collapse of the NHS in a few weeks. It is that serious”, said Christina Pagel, a member of Independent Sage and professor of operational research at University College London NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, also demanded more robust action. Referring to the Tiers review, Saffron Cordery, its deputy chief executive, said: “It will require difficult decisions, moving millions more people to the highest level.” A toughening is needed urgently because pressures on the NHS in some places is “rising at an unsustainable rate”, she said. Keir Starmer sounded a stark warning about the crisis facing the NHS and schools over the next month. The Labour leader told the Guardian that the UK was “staring down the barrel” of a third lockdown in January.

"“The choices will be things like: which patients to admit to intensive care and which can only have limited care, excluding intensive care; how long to keep trying all stops maximum therapy on someone who appears to be making little progress when someone else comes into the intensive care unit and needs a haemodialysis machine when there are only limited numbers of machines; and who gets an intensive care or ventilatory support bed if all are being used,” she said. Paoloni also warned that hospitals may have to stop providing non-Covid care, even including cancer surgery, despite NHS England’s promises to try to protect such treatment during the second wave. A hospital may have to ask itself ‘can we do the cancer surgery today or not, as we only have limited beds and no spare intensive care capacity for emergencies if we use the last bed for a major cancer operation?’,” she said. Screening for diseases such as cancer may also have to halt and patients have to wait longer for an ambulance to respond to a 999 call, she added. With the NHS facing the most serious emergency in its 72-year history, some hospitals are considering setting up tents outside in which to triage patients. This is in response to the long queues of ambulances that are building up outside many A&amp;E departments, containing patients who sometimes spend hours in the vehicles waiting admission. Ambulances were seen queueing on Tuesday outside hospitals including the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel and Queen’s hospital in Romford, both in east London, and Queen Elizabeth hospital, Birmingham. The tent plan was revealed by A&amp;E consultant Dr Simon Walsh, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultants committee, who said it was the sort of measure usually used after a major incident such as a terror attack or industrial disaster. NHS staff were preparing for a “worsening, increasing number of admissions” with Covid in the next few weeks as the number of infections continues to spiral, he said. Walsh urged the government produce a plan to respond to the increasing chaos in the service. The Doctors’ Association UK said Covid had led to “a cataclysmic escalation” in the strain the NHS was under in recent days.","The choices will include which patients to admit to intensive care and when to stop therapy for a patient who is not making much progress.

"Throughout the pandemic, technology has been saving our jobs and our sanity – but in Barcelona the lockdowns have led to the revival of one of humanity’s simplest and most enduring inventions: the book. The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango.","Throughout the pandemic, technology has been saving our jobs and our sanity – but in Barcelona the lockdowns have led to the revival of one of humanity’s simplest and most enduring inventions: the book.

"Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said.","This may happen.

"The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaxxers after figures showed that only a few hundred people had received a jab several days after the country’s vaccine programme began. Health officials said France is setting out for “a marathon, not a sprint” and that they are going slowly, in part, because of high levels of public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France have said they are willing to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when just over half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to have the vaccine is reportedly 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, beginning with staff and residents in care homes and those considered at risk of developing severe symptoms of the virus. It is the only country insisting that those offered the vaccine give their written consent after being informed of possible contraindications. However, fewer than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials. The ministry has said the aim is to vaccinate 1 million elderly and at-risk people in January, requiring more than 31,200 vaccinations every day. The health minister, Olivier Véran, admitted that France was vaccinating more slowly than other countries and suggested this was a deliberate policy to enable an information campaign rather than the result of a lack of vaccines or a logistical failure. “We have the same number of vaccine doses as our German neighbours, we have the same aims and we will have the same results,” Véran told French television. “It’s taking a while to get off the ground … I don’t confuse speed with haste,” he added. The president, Emmanuel Macron, and ministers have promised the vaccine will not be obligatory and officials have assured the public there will be no list compiled of those who refuse to have the Covid-19 jab. However, Macron said people should be guided by “reason and science”. “The vaccine is not obligatory. Have confidence in our scientists and doctors,” he said.","The French government has been accused of pandering to anti-vaccinators after figures showed only a few hundred people had received a jab after the country started its vaccine programme. Health officials said France will run a marathon, not a sprint, and they are moving slowly, partly because of high public scepticism about the vaccine. Only around 40% of people in France want to be vaccinated, according to a recent poll. The figure has dropped since October, when almost half of French people said they were happy to be vaccinated. Willingness to get the vaccine is 77% in Britain and 69% in the US. France started giving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Sunday. It started with care home staff and residents and included people at risk of severe viruses. It is the only country that insists that those who give the vaccine give their written consent after being told of possible contraindications. But less than 100 people were vaccinated in the first three days. By Wednesday evening, only 332 people had received the vaccine, according to health ministry officials.

"In his new year address on Thursday, Macron vowed to avoid “unjustifiable delays” to vaccinations but also struck a defensive note, saying he would let “no one play with the safety” of the campaign.

"Officials in Gibraltar are making daily patrols of the territory’s Barbary macaque population amid fears that the iconic monkeys could be vulnerable to the coronavirus. The British overseas territory has been relatively spared by the virus, documenting about 1,500 confirmed cases and six deaths. But as governments around the world wrestle with how to keep the coronavirus at bay, authorities in the Rock are grappling with an additional worry: how to shield Europe’s only wild monkey population from the virus. “We knew it from day one,” said Mark Pizarro, the veterinary officer responsible for the care of Gibraltar’s macaque population. “It’s logical. You have a virus that lives in primates like us, then it’s going to always be a risk to other primates.” Earlier this year the government sought to crack down on interactions with the macaques, which rank among the territory’s top tourist attractions. A new law, passed in August, made it an offence to touch or interfere with the monkeys, adding to existing legislation that sets out hefty fines for feeding them. “Macaques are prone to succumb to human disease,” the government noted in a statement announcing the new law. “This has been seen in the past when our macaques have for example contracted hepatitis A.” Believed to have been living on the Rock since the Moorish occupation of the Iberian peninsula, local folklore has it that as long as the macaques roam Gibraltar, the territory will remain under British rule. Officials have at times gone to remarkable lengths to protect the population; during the second world war, Winston Churchill gave an order to bolster their dwindling numbers with macaques from north Africa. Today the population stands at about 220 macaques. Coronavirus tests carried out in recent months on four – all of which died of other causes, such as road traffic accidents – came back negative, reinforcing the government’s view that the virus poses only a mild risk to the macaques. But concerns grew again in November after Denmark announced plans to cull more than 15 million mink over fears that new mutations discovered in the animals could undermine the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines.","Officials in Gibraltar are patrolling the Barbary macaque population daily, fearing the iconic monkeys could be at risk from coronavirus.

"The Gibraltar government described the Danish announcement as “particularly worrying” given that it suggested that the macaques, should they contract the virus, could become a source of infection for humans and potentially pass on mutations that could jeopardise vaccination efforts. Pizarro said his team of six had been monitoring the macaques on a daily basis. So far they have seen little sign of infection. What their patrols have made clear, however, is that the pandemic – and specifically the resulting plunge in tourism – has been a boon to the macaques. “Their behaviour in a lot of cases has reverted to normal.

"Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy analyst who served three decades in prison for leaking thousands of classified documents to Israel, has arrived in Tel Aviv after being released from parole. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, greeted Pollard and his wife, Esther, as they walked down the steps from a private jet, footage distributed by the prime minister’s office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, removed their masks and kissed the ground before greeting Netanyahu. “We are ecstatic to be home at last after 35 years,” said Pollard, who was born in the US but was granted Israeli citizenship during his imprisonment. “No one could be prouder of this country or this leader than we are.” After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard, 66, with Israeli identification documents. “Welcome home,” the prime minister said. Having been arrested by FBI agents in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli embassy in Washington, Pollard was sentenced to life in prison in 1987. The initial shock between the US and its close ally, and Pollard’s continued imprisonment, has long strained relations between the two countries. Netanyahu has pushed for Pollard’s release for decades. During the leader’s first term in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. However, repeated previous attempts to persuade US presidents to grant Pollard clemency have failed. Pollard’s release from parole last month was the latest in a series of gestures by the departing Trump administration towards Netanyahu’s government. In a phone call last month, Netanyahu said to Pollard: “When are we going to see you here? We’re waiting for you.” Pollard’s lawyer, Eliot Lauer, told the Times of Israel that his arrival was “a dream realised after 35 very difficult years”. The couple are expected to enter several days of quarantine, which is compulsory for all returning Israelis as a measure to guard against the spread of coronavirus.","Jonathan Pollard was a former US Navy analyst.

"Campaigners are calling for social housing providers to put lives above profits following an Observer report on a black tenant who was left homeless after a racist campaign by neighbours. Former social housing chiefs, Lord Victor Adebowale, Aman Dalvi, Lord Geoffrey Filkin and Barry Simons have signed an open letter to the National Housing Federation highlighting wider failings to protect victims of racial harassment. The letter demands an urgent review of social housing policy to ensure that perpetrators of racial harassment are evicted, or their victims rehoused as a priority. The group acted after reading of the plight of Laura Tate (not her real name) who has been homeless for five years after fleeing her flat following death threats. Her housing provider, London and Quadrant (L&amp;Q), refused to evict her abusers, despite their convictions for racially aggravated harassment and public order offences, and it failed to rehouse Tate.

"The ruthless campaign by the Chinese government to extinguish all memories of the massacre at Tiananmen Square has now resulted in the removal of the sculpture from the campus of the University of Hong Kong (Outcry as memorial to Tiananmen Square victims removed from Hong Kong University, 23 December). Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him. No doubt the chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten – who was the last British governor of Hong Kong – will be sympathetic. There is also plenty of space for the erection of a memorial near the Chinese embassy in central London.

"Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. In several videos, a woman is seen unfurling a sign that reads “Reclaim NHS, End Jab” in one of the cabins before taking a large box containing what appears to be testing equipment and papers. She is seen unmasked and smiling at the cameras as she leaves the testing site. Thames Valley police said they were aware of an anti-vaccination protest that took place in central Milton Keynes on Wednesday afternoon. In a statement, the police said: “Where criminal offences have been disclosed, we will take swift action and bring offenders to justice. “If anyone has any information or wishes to report they can do by calling 101 or online quoting reference 604 29/12/2021.” The actions of the anti-vaccine protesters at the test-and-trace centre were described as “disgraceful” and faced widespread criticism by MPs.","Anti-vaccination protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes on Wednesday.

"The local Tory MP Ben Everitt described the protesters as “dickheads” and urged anyone with information to contact police. Nick Thomas-Symonds, shadow secretary of state for international trade, described the protest as “dreadful”, at a site where “NHS staff are working over the festive season to help others”. He urged anyone with information to pass this on to Thames Valley police. Former health secretary Matt Hancock criticised the activists’ “appalling behaviour”. The Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton, Alicia Kearns, described the scenes as “shameful, self-aggrandising nonsense”. Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat MP for North Shropshire, said the group’s actions were “totally unacceptable”. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, said the scenes were “disgraceful”. “For months now we have been warning need legislation to tackle those who harass others seeking healthcare.

"An Afghan former BBC journalist who managed to flee the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government. Mudassar Kadir* is the only one of 14 former BBC employees to have escaped Afghanistan since the Taliban took over in August. The other 13 remain in hiding in fear of their lives. Kadir, who also spent time working for the World Bank and the former Afghan government, had hoped he and his family could begin a new life after leaving Afghanistan, but since escaping in early October with the help of a US charity, Kadir and his wife and two young sons have been stuck in a refugee centre on the outskirts of Dubai. The Kadirs are grateful to the United Arab Emirates for the safe haven and are being well looked afte, but they are prevented from straying more than 100m from the building and the UAE will not accept asylum applications. Kadir is exasperated by the UK government’s repeated refusals in response to his request for help, and he still lives in fear of being sent back to Afghanistan where his work for the BBC has made him a target for the Taliban. “The UK should have a duty of care to me and my family. My life is at risk because I have worked for the BBC. The UK government knows this but they have done nothing to help me,” he said. “In the beginning we hoped that the UK would give me a visa, but now with each passing day my frustration grows.” Campaigners say the family’s predicament highlights the plight of thousands of Afghan immigrants caught in limbo, unable to return home for fear of persecution and prevented from travelling anywhere willing to grant them refugee status. The UK government has promised an Afghan citizens’ resettlement scheme (ACRS) to help as many as 5,000 people a year starting in January, alongside the existing more restrictive Afghanistan relocation and assistance policy (Arap). Kadir does not qualify for Arap, which has helped fewer than 400 people so far, and he is unable apply for ACRS because it is yet to open and when it does will only accept referrals for resettlements from NGOs. Campaigners fear the UK government is deliberately delaying the implementation of the scheme in an effort to reduce numbers.","An Afghan former BBC journalist who flew to the Taliban has been stranded in a refugee camp for months because of delays to a resettlement scheme promised by the UK government.

"The Home Office denies this. “The ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK,” a spokesperson said. “We continue to work at pace to open the scheme amid a complex and changing picture, working across government and with partners such as UNHCR to design the scheme.” It refuses to discuss individual cases. When asked to explain the delay, the Home Office said it was working on a system of “biometric enrolment” and eligibility checks to ensure those accepted did not pose a threat to national security. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which is representing Kadir and many others in the same predicament, says time is running out. Its interim chief executive, Minnie Rahman, said: “Three months ago, our government promised a ‘warm welcome’ to Afghan refugees but increasingly it seems that there’s precious little welcome to be found. “Like Kadir, many Afghans appear to have been shamefully abandoned by the British government, despite clear links to the UK. The resettlement scheme is still not open, family reunion routes are still extremely limited and our government seems unable to offer many who risked their lives working with us the refuge they so urgently need.” The National Union of Journalists has been lobbying the government to help secure visas for all Afghan former BBC staff, including one who survived an armed attack on a relative’s home in October. Its general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said: “Whilst progress on the resettlement process happens at a snail’s pace, journalists affected are living in fear and being forced into hiding. We need urgent and robust measures put in place to secure safe passage to the UK for all those Afghans at such high risk.” A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We have every sympathy with former staff, but we regret we are not in a position to extend our direct support to them.” Kadir said: “My hope is that the UK government will fulfil their commitment towards me and my family. But right now it seems no one is paying attention to my case. Since arriving in the UAE two months ago there has been zero progress.” * His name has been changed","The Home Office denies this.

"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously. Middle East Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf.","The world faces many challenges.

"Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. Asia Pacific The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber.

There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi.

"A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything.

The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics.

Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace.

"Europe It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish.

Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign.

The European Commission is led by Merkel's friend Ursula von der Leyen. France takes over the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls ""strategic autonomy"". Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be tested on a range of fronts, including Ukraine.","Europe faces a tough year. The EU and national leaders must deal with tense internal and external divisions. They also face the pandemic's ongoing social and economic impact, migration and new challenges. These include the reinforced net zero emissions targets after Cop26. Moreover, Europe must decide whether it wants to be considered seriously as a global actor or will give its international influence to China, the US and bad regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán is Hungary's dictator. He has mocked the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech. For the first time, he will face a united opposition. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron is a neo-Gaullist centrist. He came from nowhere in 2017. He will ask French voters for a second term. His rivals are Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. He says they are racist and Islamophobic. Polls show Macron is ahead. However, he faces a possible strong challenge from Valérie Pécresse. She is the conservative party's candidate. The left is divided. This could make France more radical. The shift may be reactionary. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will be under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s rule. There will still be friction over budgetary policy and debt. This will be with the European Commission. It will also be with France and other southern EU members.

"Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans.

In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify.

Latin America The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago.

"Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. North America All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision.","Surveys in Europe suggest support for right-wing populist-nationalist politicians is declining, but this may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, or other parts of the world.

"The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September.","The biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions.

"But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. Africa As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022.","But in 2021’s snap election, his Liberals won the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting Trudeau’s magic is not working.

"This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa.

"The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Antarctica, the Arctic … and beyond Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon.

"The “appalling” scale of abuse, intimidation and threatening behaviour directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been laid bare in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic. Dozens of UK advisers described incidents ranging from coordinated online attacks to death threats and acts of intimidation, such as photos being taken of their homes and shared online and suspicious packages arriving in the post, some containing items with messages scrawled on them. Further harassment has included vitriolic tweets, emails and phone calls, hate mail, threats of violence, complaints sent to employers, referrals to the General Medical Council watchdog, offensive notes left on cars and abuse shouted through the letterbox. The police have brought charges in a small number of cases when individuals linked to specific threats were identified. Advisers were not the only ones targeted. The abuse spilled over to their students, colleagues and family members, including partners and children. One adviser who works as a GP said the surgery’s receptionists had been subjected to “vile tirades” from callers as a result of their advisory role. In another case, an adviser’s child was repeatedly targeted by a teacher who blamed the parent for the government’s lockdown policy. The family did not make a formal complaint because the child’s exam grade depended on the teacher’s assessment. The Guardian survey was sent to more than 100 scientists, doctors and other researchers who contribute to the advice ministers receive through bodies such as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the modelling and behavioural science subgroups that support Sage, and other expert groups such as the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The responses have been anonymised. Three-quarters of the 42 respondents received significant abuse about government policy, their views on the science, or their research findings, often after being quoted in the media or speaking at open events such as parliamentary inquiries or webinars hosted by organisations such as the UK’s various royal societies. In an article for the Guardian today, Prof John Edmunds, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, said he and junior staff were targeted regularly with abusive emails.","The ""appalling"" scale of abuse, intimidation and threats directed at the UK government’s scientific and medical advisers has been revealed in a Guardian survey of experts working on the pandemic.

"“If you mention vaccination in the media, particularly vaccination of children, then there is likely to be a reaction,” he writes. “However, this only occurs if one’s comments are picked up by the rightwing press – particularly the Daily Mail.” One of the advisers surveyed received a death threat on Twitter, which was reported to the police, and experienced a “tidal wave of abuse” whenever they appeared in the media. “A lot of it is misogynistic and a lot of it is deeply unpleasant,” a doctor said. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m just trying to do the best I can to stop people dying.” Much of the activity comes from people who feel more threatened by the government’s response to the pandemic than the pandemic itself, even though advisers are not involved in policy decisions. Many advisers say abuse peaks whenever they speak publicly about masks, vaccines, Covid treatments, circuit-breakers or lockdowns, meaning it is increasing with the spread of the Omicron variant. At the beginning of the pandemic last year, a surge in threatening behaviour led government security experts to brief the advisers on how best to protect themselves, including how to increase computer security and improve their personal safety by varying the time they travelled to work and the route they used, and checking under their car before driving. Some advisers have had security reviews of their homes and workplaces and alarms and 24-hour surveillance cameras installed, linked to the local police station. A number of universities have hired private security firms to help the experts operate safely and to ensure campaigners and protesters do not disrupt their work. Government cybersecurity experts have removed some sensitive material posted online, but this has not always been possible. Many advisers reported a stream of hate via Twitter and email, with messages such as “I hope your family die”, “I hope cunts like you are fucking held accountable”, “you will pay for killing our children with vaccines” and “fuck off back to where you came from”.

Numerous male counterparts expressed dismay at the intensity and nature of the abuse directed at women they knew. “There seems to be a huge gender imbalance with women being targeted so much more than men,” one said. Despite the torrent of abuse, several advisers emphasised that they also received praise, thanks and support from members of the public, which counterbalanced the vitriol. “It has vaccinated me against much of the hate,” one said. George Freeman, the science minister, called the abuse “appalling”. He said: “All of us who value our freedom and democracy need to call this out … Scientists and doctors should not be held responsible for decisions taken in good faith by ministers accountable to parliament.” Chi Onwurah, the shadow science minister, said the attacks were “wholly unacceptable” and the government’s much-delayed online safety bill was desperately needed to counter misinformation. While many advisers praised the Cabinet Office and the Sage secretariat for setting up “extensive support mechanisms”, some felt they would have benefited from a warning and security advice before signing up. The attention has led some scientists to keep their heads down, refuse interviews, and consider withdrawing from the public discussion. But most said the abuse had little effect or even emboldened them. “If anything, it motivated me to engage further,” one adviser said. “Clearly my voice was being heard and having an impact.” Another said: “If we stop speaking up, and stop providing advice, something else will fill the void and it will be misinformation, false narratives and so on.

"The former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani has broken his silence with his first interview since fleeing Kabul four months ago, in effect blaming the international community and in particular the Americans for the fall of the republic. Ghani told the BBC he was rushed into fleeing Kabul on a helicopter by his “terrified” national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, and the commander of the collapsing presidential security detail. “They said the PPS [presidential protection service] has collapsed, [and] if I take a stand they will all be killed,” Ghani said. “He [Mohib] did not give me more than two minutes.” He was speaking to the former chief of the British defence staff, Gen Sir Nick Carter, who was guest-editing BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Taliban were clearly on a path to controlling Afghanistan before Ghani’s flight into exile, but his hasty departure ended hopes of an orderly handover of power that might have kept some aid flowing, and scuttled plans for an inclusive government. Now Afghanistan is stalked by famine; its economy has contracted by more than a third, and its health and education sectors have been crippled by an abrupt halt to foreign funds on which they relied. Asked by Carter what he would say to the Afghan people, many of whom “blame you as their leader” for the current catastrophe, Ghani said his biggest mistake had been relying on Afghanistan’s allies. “What they rightly blame me for, they have a total right to, I trusted in our international partnership and pursued that path,” he said. “All of us made a huge mistake assuming the patience of the international community would last.” Ghani criticised Washington for leaving his government out of years of peace talks with the Taliban, claiming that deals signed under the US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad in effect sacrificed Afghans for a smooth departure of US troops. “Process-wise, outcome-wise, the responsibility has to clearly rest with the [American] team,” he said. “We were never given the opportunity to sit down with them [the Taliban].","Ashraf Ghani is the former Afghan president.

"Ambassador Khalilzad sat down with them; it became an American issue, not an Afghan issue.

"Thousands of South Africans will pause to remember the anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday aged 90, every day this week as bells are rung at churches across the country for 10 minutes at noon. Tributes to Tutu, described as the “moral compass” of his country, have poured in from around the world since his death in a Cape Town care home, as a series of events commemorating his life and achievements begin. “A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” former US president Barack Obama said in a statement. The Nobel laureate’s remains will lie in state for two days before his funeral is held on 1 January at Cape Town’s St George’s Cathedral, his former parish. The bells of the cathedral, where his ashes are to be interred, will toll for 10 minutes at noon daily until Friday in his honour. Dozens of memorial services are to be held across South Africa in the coming days and flags will be flown at half-mast. “Bells will ring at 12 noon each day at the cathedral and at many cathedrals and churches across the land. In Cape Town, the Angelus prayer will be recited,” said Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Monday. In a troubled country still divided by deep inequality, polarised politics and the legacy of the repressive, racist apartheid system, the death of one of the leading figures of the freedom struggle has brought a rare moment of unity. Members of all communities have stopped by St George’s cathedral since the news of Tutu’s death broke, many laying flowers under a portrait of the cleric fixed to a wall of remembrance alongside a South African flag, or signing a book of condolence. Among them was Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, who said the Nobel laureate “was a hero to us, he fought for us”. “We are liberated due to him.

"He was just good,” said Mokwadi, clutching the hand of her granddaughter. “His significance supersedes the boundaries of being an Anglican,” said mourner Brent Goliath, who broke down in tears outside the old stone building. He said he had been an altar boy and had met Tutu several times. “I was very emotional this morning when I heard that he’d passed away. I thank God that he has been there for us,” he said, wiping his eyes as he placed a bouquet of pink flowers under Tutu’s photo. Daphney Ramakgopa, 58, a local government worker, spoke of the loss the entire country was feeling. “We looked up to him as the adviser to everyone in the country, especially our politicians,” she said. South Africa’s cricket team wore black armbands in Tutu’s honour on day one of the first Test against India in South Africa. Cape Town’s Table Mountain was lit up in purple in his honour. South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. Ramaphosa said Tutu’s death was “another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” after the country’s last apartheid-era president FW de Klerk died in November. “Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described,” said Graça Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela. Though he had largely faded from public life in recent years, Tutu had continued his lifelong fight for causes he believed in, forcefully supporting LGBT rights, equal access to education and the assisted dying movement. The charismatic cleric, whose infectious laughter and informality masked a steely commitment to his principles, had also been fiercely critical of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party.","He was just good,"" said Mokwadi, clutching her granddaughter's hand.

"Covid regulations currently in force in South Africa would restrict attendance at the funeral to a maximum of 100, church authorities said, explaining that “only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated in the cathedral.” The service will be an Anglican requiem mass, “as Archbishop emeritus Desmond wanted”, led by Michael Nuttall, the retired bishop of Natal, who was known as “number 2 to Tutu”. The close relationship between Nuttall and Tutu in the 1980s “modelled how a white leader could work for and closely with a black leader,” Anglican church officials told reporters. Tutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on 7 October 1931. His career in the church began after he resigned a sought-after teaching post in protest at South Africa’s discriminatory laws in 1958, a decade after the victory of the National party in elections ushered in the apartheid system. After studying theology in the UK, where he would needlessly ask for directions only to be called “Sir” by white police officers. Tutu rose rapidly up the religious hierarchy. By the late 1970s, Tutu was one of the leaders of the freedom struggle best known overseas and played a leading role in forcing western leaders to confront the moral cost of cold war calculations that led to tacit support for white-minority rule in South Africa. In 1984, Tutu’s commitment to non-violent struggle won him the Nobel peace prize and he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town shortly afterwards When Mandela became president after South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, Tutu coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe his homeland and then led the truth and reconciliation commission, which revealed the horrors of apartheid. But Tutu did not spare his country’s new rulers, challenging Mandela, a close friend, over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticising the rule of president Jacob Zuma, which ended in 2018 amid allegations of systematic graft. Tutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and repeatedly underwent treatment. His public appearances became rarer.","Church authorities explained the current Covid regulations in South Africa.

"In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation.","It was a terrible year for human rights in Russia.

"In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”","Memorial spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities.

"A handful of local administrations in Spain have become among the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to strike a better balance between workplace demands and period pains. This year the Catalan city of Girona became the first in the country to consider flexible working arrangements for any employee experiencing discomfort due to periods. In June it announced a deal with its more than 1,300 municipal employees to allow women, trans men and non-binary individuals to take up to eight hours menstrual leave a month, with the caveat that any time used must be recovered within a span of three months. “Girona is known for many things and I think today we’re adding a new item to the list as we pioneer the approval of menstrual leave,” the city’s deputy mayor, Maria Àngels Planas, said at the time. “We are eliminating the taboo that exists around menstruation and the pain that some women suffer – that we suffer – during menstruation.” Soon afterwards the Catalan municipalities of Ripoll and Les Borges Blanques announced similar policies. In September the eastern Spanish city of Castellón de la Plana said it had signed an agreement with its 1,500 municipal workers that included a menstrual leave policy similar to Girona’s after requests from several employees. Period policies have long been enshrined in law in many parts of Asia, often rooted in concerns that workplace demands could hinder women’s ability to bear children. In 2016 the Guardian spoke to several women in Japan and China who said they were reluctant to use the entitlement over fears that doing so would antagonise male colleagues or damage their chances of a promotion. That same year Coexist, a social enterprise in Bristol, said it would become one of the first workplaces in the west to embrace menstrual leave, hoping to do away with an office culture that forced employees to choose between working while grappling with severe menstrual symptoms or using sick days or holiday. The decision triggered global debate over the policy’s merits, even as managers at Coexist reported increased commitment and productivity, and research suggested as many as 14% of women had taken time off from work or school due to periods. It was against this backdrop that the local workers union in Girona first proposed the measure.","Some local administrations in Spain have become the first in western Europe to offer menstrual leave to their employees, in an attempt to balance workplace demands and periods pains.

"“There was a lot of controversy,” said Sílvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union. Union reps initially considered asking for up to two days of leave a month, but the idea was quashed owing to concerns that it might make employers more reluctant to hire women or give them decision-making roles. “To avoid any discrimination based on sex, we made it so that any hours used would be made up later,” said Rubio. The negotiations with the city council proved another obstacle, forcing them to whittle down their initial request of 16 hours a month to eight hours. But what surprised many of them was that the policy was also a tough sell among some of their colleagues. “There was a lot of conflict,” she said. “We had women who said: ‘My husband has migraines, why can’t he take this leave?’” Others worried the policy would stigmatise women or brand menstruation as something that is always painful. Rubio responded by pointing to the wider picture. “We think it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved this. This is a women’s issue around the globe, there’s a lot of embarrassment around it and nobody is tackling it. We managed to do it,” she said. “But we don’t want the struggle to end here.” Instead she saw the policy as a first step towards building a workplace culture that would allow greater flexibility to address needs ranging from chronic illness to care obligations. “All of this ends up being a journey to improve workplaces for both women and men, and in both the public and the private sector.”","""There was a lot of controversy,"" said Slvia Rubio of the Intersindical-CSC union.

"France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. New infections in Australia rose to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous high of about 11,300 a day earlier. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the country needed “a gear change”. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants was driving an alarming wave of infections that could lead to increases in hospitalisation and deaths. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he was “highly concerned that Omicron, spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases”. The WHO has said Omicron poses a “very high” risk and could submerge health systems. Studies in Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggest Omicron is less deadly than some of its predecessors, but the huge numbers of people testing positive mean hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed and businesses could struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. The rapid transmission rate of the new variant is forcing governments to find a delicate balance between reimposing restrictions to protect hospitals and keeping economies and societies open.","France has set a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with many countries hitting new highs.

"Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10, even as the number of new infections hit record highs, after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. The Italian cabinet decided on Wednesday night to scrap the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. The cabinet also tightened measures against the unvaccinated, and from 10 January a health pass proving immunisation or recovery from coronavirus will be required when travelling by bus, metro, train and taking domestic flights. Meanwhile, a proposal to tighten measures against unvaccinated workers was rejected. Authorities reported another new record daily tally of 98,030 cases on Wednesday. French MPs on Wednesday started debating a new law that would allow only vaccinated people to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums, sports arenas and other public venues, with a negative Covid test no longer to be accepted. Italy is one of several countries to have cancelled or restricted public celebrations since the resurgence of the virus. Greece, which has also banned Christmas and new year festivities in public places, on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on the hospitality sector, bringing forward measures planned for early January, after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double Monday’s figure. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when they can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid-January to go back to our normal lives,” said the health minister, Thanos Plevris. Some countries are still waiting for the Omicron wave to hit. Case numbers are still falling in Germany, but its health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the true number could be much higher because fewer tests were being done over the holiday season. He said the real incidence was “two or three times as high” as Wednesday’s reported rate of 205 Covid cases per 100,000 people over seven days, the lowest since November, adding that a sharp jump was expected “within a very short period of time”.","Spain shorted its Covid self-isolation time.

"On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered organisers of sports events to hold them behind closed doors.

In Belgium, however, where case numbers are also relatively low, the government reversed course on Wednesday, allowing theatres and cinemas to reopen after a court suspended their closure. Meanwhile, other European countries are still grappling with the Delta variant. Poland reported 794 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest number in the fourth wave of the pandemic. The deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said more than 75% of those who died were unvaccinated.","On Tuesday Germany closed nightclubs and ordered sports events to hold them behind closed doors.

"Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure. “The Russians understand that if they lose Kreminna, their entire line of defence will fall,” Haidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. “The Russian occupation troops managed to build a very powerful defence in a month, even a little more. They are bringing there a huge amount of reserves and equipment. They are constantly renewing their forces.” The Guardian could not independently confirm the battlefield developments. Recapturing Kreminna and nearby Svatove could open the way for Kyiv to launch an offensive on Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, two cities Ukraine lost in the summer. The fierce fighting continues amid no sign of imminent peace talks. Late on Monday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Kyiv must accept Moscow’s demands of “demilitarisation and denazification” or suffer defeat on the battlefield. Lavrov’s statements show the Kremlin has no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin’s claims on Sunday that Russia was ready for talks to end the war. In its daily military briefing on Tuesday, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian troops continued to focus their efforts on capturing the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. Russian soldiers, alongside fighters from the Wagner private military group, have been trying to seize Bakhmut since July, after reaching the outskirts of the city. Bakhmut has been largely ravaged after nearly five months of fighting and has been referred to by both sides as the “Bakhmut meat-grinder”. The battle for Bakhmut is seen as an important test for the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is believed to have recruited thousands of Russian convicts to help storm the city.","Ukrainian forces seem to be closer to retaking the key-Russian-controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province as heavy fighting continued in the east and south of the country.

"Prigozhin has previously criticised the Russian defence ministry for its performance in Ukraine and has lauded Wagner as the country’s most capable fighting force. In a video published on Monday and purportedly filmed near Bakhmut that will further fuel speculations over tensions within the Russian forces, two apparent Wagner soldiers are seen insulting the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. “You are … the damn devil. We have nothing to fight with, we have no shells,” one of the men is heard saying. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage, but when asked about the video by Russian journalists, Prigozhin appeared to express his approval for the actions of the soldiers, saying he travelled to Bakhmut to meet them. “The guys asked me to convey that when you sit in a warm office, the problems of the frontline are hard to hear,” Prigozhin said in a statement, in an apparent dig at the country’s top military command. Last Thursday, Ukraine claimed Russia had “relocated” some of its aircraft away from the Engels airfield, which Moscow said was struck by a Ukrainian drone a day earlier, resulting in the death of three Russian servicemen. “After yesterday’s well-known events, we see that the planes are dispersed there, namely strategic aviation … Of course, a certain number of aircraft still remain there, but many of them have already been relocated to various airfields,” Col Yuriy Ignat, the chief spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command, told Ukrainian media. Elsewhere, Russia’s security services claimed they had “liquidated” four Ukrainian soldiers who were on a reconnaissance mission in Russia’s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine’s border. If confirmed, the incident sheds light on the ongoing activities of Ukrainian saboteurs inside Russian territory.

"European countries are preparing to scale up the monitoring of potential new coronavirus variants from China, as Spain and France brought back mandatory testing at airports in response to Beijing’s rapid rollback of anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring arrivals from China to show a negative test result, though unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. At a press conference announcing Spain’s new measures, the country’s health minister, Carolina Darias, also said she was pushing to revise the conditions that had to be met in order for travellers to obtain the EU’s digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have prompted the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was “discriminatory” and politically motivated in an attempt to undermine China’s reopening. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, however, officials said this week it was important to be vigilant but too early to raise alarm over the outbreak in the world’s most populous country. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany. Data on Covid variants provided by Beijing was not sufficiently reliable, the centre-left politician said. “And therefore we very much have to rely on doing that ourselves,” for example by carefully looking at individual flights, he said. The European Commission’s health policy chief on Friday urged the EU’s 27-member states to consider scaling up gene sequencing of Covid-19 infections and monitoring of wastewater, including from airports, to detect any new variants that could be brought in from China. In a letter to health ministers of the EUmember states, Stella Kyriakides said the bloc should be “very vigilant” when China lifts travel restrictions on 8 January, since reliable epidemiological and testing data for China were quite scarce.","European countries are planning to increase monitoring of potential new coronaviruses from China. Spain and France have brought back mandatory tests at airports, because Beijing is quickly removing anti-infection measures. The two countries on Friday followed Italy’s lead by requiring Chinese arrivals to show a negative test result, but unlike Rome, Spain makes exceptions for those who can prove they are fully vaccinated. Spain's health minister announced new measures at a press conference. Carolina Darias. She said she was trying to change the conditions for travellers. These conditions are for the EU's digital Covid certificate. A rise in infections across China and doubts over the regime’s official data have led to the return of Covid checks in several countries outside the EU, including the US, India, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The UK has announced a similar move. Chinese state media said the return of such testing requirements for travellers from China was ""discriminatory"" and politically motivated to undermine China's reopening. Officials in Brussels, Berlin and Paris talked this week. They said it was important to be vigilant. But they said it was too early to raise alarm. This is about the outbreak in the world's most populous country. Germany’s health minister Karl Lauterbach said it was “not yet necessary” to bring back mandatory testing for travellers coming into the borderless Schengen area from China via Germany.

"In the letter, Kyriakides advised ministers to assess their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus “as an immediate step”, Reuters reported. Earlier in the week, Italy’s far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, argued that requiring Covid tests for all passengers from China was “only effective if it is taken at the European level”, noting that many people arrive in Italy on connecting flights through other European countries. After an announcement made by Italy’s health ministry on Thursday, travellers from China are obliged to show a negative test result upon embarking on their flight and to take a second antigen test upon their arrival.","In the letter, Kyriakides told ministers to review their practices on gene sequencing of the coronavirus ""as an immediate step,"" Reuters reported.

"Brazil has been gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepared to both welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons. Huge crowds are expected in Brasilia on 1 January to see Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva inaugurated for a four-year term, while a day later football fans will gather in Santos to bid farewell to Pelé, the football legend who died on Thursday. Edson Arantes do Nascimento died of multiple organ failure after battling colon cancer for more than a year. The 82-year-old former Santos and New York Cosmos player had been in hospital for more than a month. “The city is in mourning,” said Walter Dias, an 87-year-old journalist who covered Santos during their glory days in the 1960s and remained a friend to both Pelé and his family. “Everyone here is sad because at the end of the day Pelé was such a part of our lives. He brought us so much joy. It’s like we’ve lost a member of the family.” Brazilian funerals customarily take place within 24 hours of bereavement, but Pelé’s family reportedly asked for more time to allow family members to gather for what is expected to be an emotional farewell. Pelé was married three times and had seven children and many more grandchildren. Some live in the United States and others are scattered across Brazil, a nation almost as big as Europe. Big crowds are expected to converge in the city and surrounding area that is home to almost 2 million people, and the world’s media will also be there in massive numbers. The outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was named Jair after the former Santos player Jair da Rosa Pinto, is not expected to attend the funeral. Reports on Friday said the far-right president would fly to Florida in the coming hours and avoid handing over the sash of office to his leftist successor. In his final address as president on Friday, Bolsonaro criticised Lula’s new cabinet as well as one of his own supporters who was caught in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel lorry ahead of Sunday’s inauguration.","Brazil is gearing up for one of the most monumental new years in its history as the South America nation prepares to welcome a new president and say goodbye to one of its most famous sons.

"That terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia, and the weekend is set to be both tense and festive – but whatever happens could be overshadowed by the following day’s events. Although dignitaries from more than 120 nations are due to attend Lula’s inauguration, Pelé’s death is a truly global story and preparations for his farewell are akin to a state funeral. Presidents, prime ministers, sports stars and former teammates all sent messages of love and sympathy after the news of his death broke on Thursday afternoon. Bolsonaro decreed three days of state mourning. The incoming leader, Lula, said: “Few Brazilians have taken our country’s name as far as he has. However different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: ‘Pelé.’” In a sombre message, the president of Santos, the club where Pelé made his name, said he would never be forgotten. “Pelé did not die, Pelé is eternal and he will live in our hearts forever,” Andres Rueda said. “He came here to Santos as a boy, and he left as a king. He was idolised not just by the Santos nation but by the whole of Brazil and by all football fans. Edson, rest in peace. Pelé, keep watching over us.” Santos said Pelé’s body is being held at the Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo until the early hours of Monday morning, when it will be taken 50 miles down the coast to the club’s Vila Belmiro stadium. The coffin will be laid in the middle of the pitch and fans will be allowed into the ground to pay their respects. His body will be laid out in the centre circle for 24 hours before being taken for a private family funeral at 10am on Tuesday. The funeral cortege will leave the ground and be driven through the streets of the port city, along the road where Pelé’s mother, Celeste, who celebrated her 100th birthday in November, still resides.","The terrorist threat has darkened the mood in Brasilia.

He wanted to be laid to rest on the ninth floor because his father, Dondinho, wore the No 9 shirt as a player. The location has a view overlooking the Vila Belmiro stadium and was chosen by Pelé because it transmitted “spiritual peace and tranquility” and “didn’t look like a cemetery”, O Globo said. “I think there will be lots of people,” Dias said of the public commemoration. “The city is preparing and people will turn out.

"As 2022 began, while swaths of the world were struggling with Covid and a looming war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm. Xi Jinping’s zero-Covid strategy was working and cases were low. There were lockdowns but they were orderly and people were compliant. This stability was exactly what Xi probably hoped would surround his taking of a historic third term, at the helm of a rising China. Economic dominance, domestic control, an annexed Taiwan, and increased global influence were all on the agenda. But as the year closes and 2023 begins, China is, instead, entering uncharted territory. In the last 12 months there have been significant housing and economic issues, the Taiwan strait crisis in August, western sanctions on China’s human rights abuses and US curbs on its burgeoning chips industry, and a messy friendship with Russia. Xi took his third term, but weeks later protests swept the country, featuring astonishingly brave acts of dissent and appearing to herald the abrupt end of the zero-Covid policy. Politically, 2022 was supposed to be a year of glory for the Chinese president, but instead it “gave Xi much more to worry about than to gloat over”, says the veteran China expert Jerome Cohen. “His country is in turmoil, and he has suffered a lot of damage in the eyes of the masses.” At the 20th party congress in October, Xi secured a third five-year term, becoming China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. It upended what his predecessors had established specifically to prevent power centralising around an individual. He enshrined “Xi Jinping thought” as the core of the party’s platform, and purged members of a rival faction, symbolised by the bizarre removal of the faction’s leader, the former president Hu Jintao, from the Congress hall. Xi’s now unchecked political power has provoked fears over what decisions he may make while surrounded by yes-people. “Xi securing a third term is, in my view, the biggest thing for China in 2022,” says Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute.","As 2022 began, while parts of the world were struggling with Covid and a war in Ukraine, life in China was relatively calm.

"“Xi may think that he has a good chart (Xi Jinping Thought) to guide China moving forward, but he is effectively taking China into uncharted territory.” The most alarming of Xi’s plans is to annex Taiwan, but analysts do not foresee any attempt to take it in the near future. The past year had a record-breaking increase in Chinese military activity towards the self-ruled democracy. In August, the Xi era’s first white paper on Taiwan reiterated the Chinese Communist party’s (CCP) willingness to use force to take the island. A visit by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei gave Beijing cause to demonstrate its force, escalating already aggressive military harassment to record levels. The US is a key player in cross-strait relations and has increased its support for Taiwan with signals about giving it “non-major Nato ally” status, and big defence spending bills to sell it weapons. Ma Chun-Wei, of Tamkang University in Taiwan, says China cannot really counter the US so instead directs reaction at Taiwan and its 23.5 million people. Cognitive and cyberwarfare and acts of economic coercion are expected to increase before Taiwan’s next presidential elections in early 2024. “China will dial up its coercive actions against Taiwan … as long as the [independence-leaning] Democratic Progressive party is in power, there is little question,” says Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center thinktank. On Monday, Taiwan reported 71 Chinese air force aircraft including fighter jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone over the previous 24 hours, the largest reported incursion to date. The CCP’s moves on Taiwan have been a key reason for Xi’s plummeting relationship with the west. The party’s continued persecution of dissenters in Hong Kong and abuses in Xinjiang – which the UN’s human rights chief declared in August may amount to crimes against humanity – have also increased the division.

"The invasion caused a political headache for Xi and has left him in a complicated spot on the world stage for as long as the war continues. He has had to balance his alliance with Putin, his wish to avoid getting caught up in anti-Russia sanctions, and the ongoing China-Russia rivalry for soft power – and trade routes – in central Asia. US officials said in March that Putin had asked China for weapons support. Beijing did not answer the call but has provided help in other ways, including apparent cooperation on propaganda and disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against western sanctions. Chinese officials have offered explicit approval of the invasion, and the two countries’ armies recently conducted joint military drills. Meanwhile, brawling diplomats have also not helped Xi’s relationship with the west. In December, China’s consul general in Manchester, England, and five other diplomats were sent home by Beijing and escaped questioning by UK police for their role in beating up a pro-Hong Kong democracy protester outside the consulate in the city in October. But global relationships still matter to Xi. After he inked his third term he hit the global meeting ground running, talking to dozens of heads of states, including Joe Biden. Cohen says Xi is trying to improve his government’s image “after too many strident and provocative policies”. Xi’s overtures will test the global community, which had taken a tougher stance on China’s human rights this year, says Maya Wang, the associate director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “I worry that, after these kinds of outreach, many governments, for example Germany, would soften their approach to China, pushing human rights from the fore to the back burner, once again,” she says. For now, government stances remain tough, and the US is pushing ahead with measures, including sanctions on China’s semiconductor industry, which Japan and the Netherlands are expected to join, causing trouble for Xi’s plans to get the faltering Chinese economy back on track. Soas’s Tsang says these measures “may have longer and wider impact [than Covid] on the economy of China in 2023”.

"To address the property collapse, the CCP has allocated 1.4tn yuan (£166bn) to restarting construction projects, which Trivium analysts believe “will allow developers to start ramping up construction” and boost China’s economy. But the government will still be reckoning with the economic fallout of zero-Covid and the coming waves of outbreaks now the policy has gone.

For two years China ran the strategy that allowed most people to live a largely normal life, and kept deaths low. But then the highly transmissible Omicron overwhelmed the policy, wreaking economic and social chaos. As people lost tolerance with rampant sudden and badly run lockdowns, sporadic protests broke out that were further inflamed by a string of fatal tragedies, including a quarantine bus crash and a building fire in locked-down Xinjiang. What became the most significant protests in China since 1989 were mostly against the deprivations of Covid-zero, but censorship complaints and anti-Xi sentiment also featured. The protests awakened some Chinese to the government’s treatment of their minority and dissident compatriots. “The pandemic fiasco has increased popular awareness of the party’s lack of respect for the laws and regulations it has promulgated, despite its great efforts to establish a ‘rule by law’ regime,” Cohen says. Authorities launched a swift police response to shut down dissent, but the protests seemed to have had an effect: within a week, the zero-Covid system that many thought would be in place for many more months, if not years, was abruptly dismantled.

"China is preparing for another wave of Covid to hit its more vulnerable countryside in early 2023, as the current wave of infections overwhelms hospitals and intensive care units in many cities. The lunar new year, China’s most important holiday, falls in late January. It offers a chance of reunion after years of separation under the harsh internal travel restrictions and lockdowns of the previous zero-Covid policy. But as hundreds of millions of workers head home, many are expected to take the disease with them, to areas that have fewer hospitals and clinics, fewer medical professionals, less equipment and medicine, and less money to pay for care. “In the face of a virus like Omicron, all people should be equal, but the fact is that as far as the virus is concerned, urban and rural areas are not equal,” said one post on the Chinese social media platform WeChat, from a user in a small town in central Henan province. “Not only are resources and opportunities unequal but there is also a wide gap in the understanding of how to handle public health.” The next wave of infections is likely to hit rural areas in late winter, the British health analytics company Airfinity predicts, and could affect even more people than the one racing through cities now. The toll may be worsened by the government’s abrupt shift in propaganda messaging about Covid. The virus had been presented as a menace to be avoided at almost any cost, but now Chinese citizens are told it is little worse than a cold. “My home town has quietly changed the way they talk about getting sick,” said the person posting on WeChat from Henan. “‘Every family has caught the cold’, so there is nothing to be afraid of.” That position means there is little official promotion of basic measures such as social distancing that could slow the spread of the disease and possibly buy time for overwhelmed hospitals. Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University, said: “I’m very surprised that the messaging seems to be denial of the depth of suffering from this wave and, as far as I’ve seen, no communication about flattening the curve to reduce pressure on its overburdened health systems.","China is preparing for another wave of Covid.

"As such, I would expect staggering death totals, as predicted by models looking at the experience of Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, on the order of 1 million.” In some urban areas, Covid has spread so fast that infections may soon reach a peak, analysts believe, although the course of the disease is difficult to trace because when China cut back on disease controls, it also cut back on publishing Covid statistics. China was once proud of its Covid statistics. Then, as deaths and infections mounted, the National Health Commission (NHC) said it would no longer publish a daily death toll. On Friday, despite widely circulating images and stories of hospitals unable to cope with the influx of patients, the NHC said there had been one Covid death and 5,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, AFP reported. By contrast, Airfinity estimates that about 9,000 people a day are dying from Covid in China. Next month that could rise to as many as 25,000 a day, and the company forecasts a death toll by April of up to 1.7 million people. An NHC spokesperson, Jiao Yahui, admitted this week that China was excluding from tolls many deaths that would be counted in other countries as Covid fatalities, AFP reported. Elsewhere in the world, any death within 28 days of a positive nucleic acid test is counted. Beijing has decided to count only those who die of respiratory failure caused by the virus. “China has always been committed to the scientific criteria for judging Covid-19 deaths, from beginning to end, which are in line with the international criteria,” Jiao said. While China’s propaganda systems are claiming the government’s sudden pivot on the pandemic – from harsh controls to letting the disease rip – has been managed perfectly, social media is filled with the grim realities of life mid-pandemic. Chinese authorities are normally quick to stifle online dissent and criticism, but a surprising number of posts discussing the reality of Covid in China today are making it online and staying up for some time, said Charlie Smith, a co-founder of Greatfire.org, a censorship monitoring site. “Most of these posts are surviving because the censorship boundaries are changing so quickly and the censors cannot keep up.","So I would expect a huge death toll, as models in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong predict, of 1 million."".

"Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island’s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan’s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island’s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday – the largest reported incursion to date. “As long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,” President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. “Taiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.” The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China’s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said “a few things” had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan’s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine’s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance.","Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year, amid rising tensions with China, the island’s president has announced.

"Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan’s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi’s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. “The United States’ commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,” the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was “getting more serious than ever”, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island’s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi’s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island’s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers “a better living environment” for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office.

"Kherson city was liberated by Ukrainian forces in November. But for some, the horrors of the Russian occupation are still not over. Nadia* sent her 14-year-old son to a Russian-run summer camp in Crimea – occupied by Moscow since 2014 – in October. He was meant to return after two weeks. It has now been more than two months. In late November, he forwarded her a series of chilling voice messages from his camp leader telling him he would not be allowed back to Kherson because of his pro-Ukraine views. “You are in Russia! You shouldn’t be doing different [types] of weird bullshit,” the camp leader in Yevpatoria, Crimea, said in the voice messages, which have been forwarded to the Guardian. “I don’t know who is going to deal with you now, but you are not going back to Kherson, that’s 100% [certain] … You can thank your mother for that.” Like many parents, Nadia did not see sending her child to such a camp – known as summer camps even at other times of year – as making a pro-Russia statement. Parents often decided to send their children because their classmates were going and they were being offered a free holiday by the sea. Nadia’s son left Kherson on 4 October and his stay at the camp was repeatedly extended by the authorities, said his mother, speaking from central Kherson after Russian forces left the city. At first, the camp leaders told her that this was for safety reasons and then, after Ukrainian forces had entered Kherson city, they said he could not return because the city was now “occupied” by Ukraine. In the messages, the camp leader outlined his problem with the boy. Firstly, his Telegram profile picture featured a Ukrainian trident, Ukraine’s national symbol, on the wall in the background. Secondly, his mother had said she wanted her son to return to Ukraine, signifying that she saw Kherson city as part of Ukraine, not Russia, thereby going against the grain of Russian propaganda that still insists the city is part of Russia.

"Over the summer, Russia offered parents in the occupied areas of Ukraine a chance to send their children to summer camps in Crimea and southern Russia for free. But it has been refusing to return the children to their parents, citing the ongoing fighting as well as Ukraine’s “occupation” of areas Russia claimed to have annexed and has now retreated from. Parents are told they can collect the children if they come in person, which requires them to cross the dangerous unofficial checkpoint through the frontline or leave Ukraine and travel via Poland and the Baltics. But many of the parents are from very low-income backgrounds and have not been able to make the journey. Though the parents sent them willingly, they had agreed to a short stint. The UN convention on children’s rights bans the “illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad”, so Russia is obliged to return the children. The Guardian spoke to eight parents who had sent their children to the summer camps. Some say they believe that Russia wants to use the children to exchange for Russian prisoners of war. Others believe Moscow wants to assimilate the children and plan to keep them in Russia. The camps were advertised through schools in the occupied areas as restorative breaks, offering a mix of sports, arts, games, and sea air or lake swimming. But the children have also been taught Russian narratives about the invasion of Ukraine, Russian and Soviet history as well as Russian culture, according to several interviewed and videos posted online. In one video, hundreds of children can be seen in a school playground in Crimea singing the Russian national anthem. Most appear not to know the words. The hundreds of children stuck in the Russian-run summer camps are in addition to the thousands of children living in orphanages in the occupied areas who were illegally taken to Russia during the Russian occupation. Ukraine’s human right’s ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, has said this is part of Russia’s “genocide against Ukraine”, erasing Ukrainian identity through “re-educating the future generations”. Lubinets said the Russians were not interested in returning the children, and though Ukraine was trying, “the return of each child is like a special operation”.

Lubinets said the Russians were not interested in returning the children and though Ukraine tried, ""the return of each child is like a special operation"". Ukraine asks parents not to publicly name their children as they then become harder to exchange."
"For a domestic audience, Russia portrays the deportation of the children as an attempt to save Ukrainian children from the war – ignoring Russia’s role in starting the conflict. Since October, the children have started attending Russian schools while living on the camps’ premises. It is not clear what plans Russia has for these children beyond this school term. One of them is Natalia’s* 12-year-old daughter, who left her home in Balakliia in late August and is still in southern Russia, attending a school in Krasnodar by bus. Natalia has managed to keep in daily contact with her but cannot afford to make the journey to collect her. “I think it’s some sort of blackmail,” said Natalia. “I think they want to use them as bargaining chips.” In at least some cases, the Russian camp leaders have said they do not plan to send the children back. In other cases, children have been moved from one camp to another without the parents being informed. Ivana*, a mother from Kherson region, made the long journey to collect her daughter from a camp in Crimea, only to be told the child was not there any more and had been moved to a camp in the Republic of Adygea. She then made a second long trip, where eventually she found her. * * * Exactly how many Ukrainian children remain in Russian hands is very difficult to tell. In mid-October, Russia’s state news agency Tass said there were about 4,500 children from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in Crimean summer camps. Natalia said at least 100 of those who travelled with her daughter were still there. Recent videos taken from some of the five camps in Crimea hosting children from Kherson indicate that at least several hundred children are still there. Part of the issue is that many of the parents refuse to come forward to the Ukrainian authorities. Dmytro*, who managed to get his son back by threatening a teacher into putting him on a bus in early October, said parents he knew feared being labelled as collaborators or supporters of Russia. They were trying to resolve things on their own, he said, without official help.","For a domestic audience, Russia portrays the deportation of the children as an attempt to save Ukrainian children from the war – ignoring Russia’s role in starting the conflict.

"An adviser to the new Kherson regional authorities on missing people, Volodymyr Zhdanov, questioned how the parents “could give their children to the occupiers”, though he admitted it was a grey area and the full picture was unclear. “We are hearing a lot of stories through the grapevine [of children stuck in Crimea],” said Zhdanov, who noted that the gathering of information on what had happened in occupied Kherson was only just beginning. “But the police say parents have not come forward.” Andrii Kovanyi, a spokesperson for Kherson police, said they could not comment on the matter as it was being dealt with by several bodies. Most parents and children who attended the camps said the conditions were good. Children were given the equivalent of hotel rooms to share, taken to see dolphins, to museums and to the beach. The Russian-appointed authorities in Crimea claim to have spent 1.2bn rubles (£16.4m) in 2022 on the camps, which were also attended by Russian children. The idea behind the camps appears to be to demonstrate the best of Russia and to integrate the children into their new state. In interviews, the adults in charge portray themselves and others as saving children who are victims of the war as well as the Ukrainian state. In videos from the children’s camps posted on the Russian-installed Kherson authority’s social media, children can be seen with the Russian flag, singing the Russian national anthem as well as classic Soviet songs. A nine-year-old girl in Kherson city, whose mother collected her in October, said that as well as games and sports they had lectures “about the war”. One history teacher from Kherson, Maksym Ivchenko, who like many other teachers accompanied the children to Crimea, was asked by Russia’s Crimea24 TV to explain how the history curriculum in Russia differed from that of Ukraine. “The most egregious thing was the reversal of modern history.

"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said Wednesday morning. A maternity wing of a hospital in Kherson city was shelled by Russian forces late on Tuesday, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has secured the release of 1,456 prisoners of war since Russia invaded in February, according to Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president was speaking in an annual address to the Ukrainian parliament, where Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, cabinet ministers, foreign diplomats, military personnel and family members of fallen soldiers were reportedly present. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine.","It's almost 9pm in Kyiv.

"Footage shows the aftermath of the strike where windows were shattered and staff and patients were forced to take cover in the basement. One staff member told reporters: I don’t even want to think about [what could have happened]’ after surgeons were in theatre just 30 minutes earlier. The secret to Igor Pedin’s survival had been his invisibility, the 61-year-old had said. With his dog, Zhu-Zhu, the former ship’s cook banked on being ignored by the trigger-happy Russian soldiers and their killing machines when he took the first step of a 140-mile journey from his home in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on 23 April, before stealing out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories towards the relative safety in the city of Zaporizhzhia. Such were the risks that soldiers at one checkpoint had beseeched Pedin to turn back but then stuffed cigarettes in his pockets for good luck. He did survive, against the odds, but the remarkable story has made Pedin more visible than he could ever have imagined. Read the full story here: Ukrainian officials are urging residents to evacuate from the city of Kherson as Russian forces stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on the recently liberated southern Ukrainian city. Some residents who lived through the Russian occupation are reluctant to leave despite the bombardment, according to a local official who has been involved in the evacuation. Kherson city council member, Dmytro Poddubniy, told CNN: I’m telling these people that Kherson is one of the most dangerous cities right now. So I ask them to imagine that they are going on vacation for a couple of weeks. It may be easier for them to decide to move this way. But still, a lot of people are staying in the city. One Kherson resident, Inna Balyoha, told the news channel she was afraid her elderly and sick mother would not be able to endure the journey. She said: She is very weak. She will not reach another city. Many remain in Kherson under shelling because of their parents. Authorities have urged Kherson residents to evacuate to safer regions as Russian shelling has become “more and more frequent and large-scale”.","Video shows the aftermath of the strike. The windows were broken. Staff and patients had to cover. They stayed in the basement. One staff member told reporters: I don’t want to think about [what might have happened]’ after surgeons were in the theatre just 30 minutes earlier. The secret to Igor Pedin’s survival was his invisibility, the 61-year-old said. The former ship's cook began a 140-mile journey from Mariupol on 23 April. He had his dog, Zhu-Zhu. He wanted the trigger-happy Russian soldiers to ignore him. He then went into the Russian-occupied badlands to Zaporizhzhia.

"A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow-installed court in the Russian-annexed peninsula found her guilty of carrying an explosive device, in a trial rights activists have described as “trumped-up” and “illegal”. Iryna Danilovich was sentenced to seven years in a general regime colony by a court in Russian-controlled Feodosia, Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, the Kyiv-based organisation Institute of Mass Information (IMI) said. The Crimean human rights activist, nurse and citizen journalist was detained by Russian authorities in late April while on her way from work. Her family told CNN at the time balaclava-clad officials from the Russian special police unit searched her house in the village of Vladislavovka, near Feodosiya, and took the family’s laptops and phones. Her case was part of a string of disappearances of activists, journalists and ordinary citizens reported over the last decade in Russian-occupied Crimea. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) called on Russian authorities in Crimea to disclose any information concerning Danilovich’s whereabouts when she first went missing. In a statement, Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said: Iryna Danilovich’s alarming disappearance prompts fears of yet another clampdown on independent reporting in Russian-occupied Crimea, which is already an extremely restrictive environment for the press. Russia’s security service (FSB) accused Danilovich of making an explosive device and keeping it on her person, IMI said. She was also fined 50,000 rubles (£570) on the charges of illegal storage and manufacture of explosives under Part 1 of Art. 222.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, it said. Volodymyr Chekryhin, deputy head of the Crimean Human Rights Group, said that the case against Danylovich was grossly falsified, starting with Russian FSB officers effectively kidnapping her.","A Crimean human rights activist has been sentenced to seven years in prison.

"He said: The entire so-called ‘investigation’ against her was comprised of illegal methods: having been kidnapped, Iryna was kept in the basement of the FSB office and faced with various forms of pressure and intimidation, even torture – she was beaten and strangled.

"Volodymyr Zelenskiy said “only a few” civilians remain in the embattled frontline city of Bakhmut in the eastern province of Donetsk. In a Telegram post, Ukraine’s leader said “there is no place that is not covered with blood” in the Ukrainian-held city, where his troops are waging a battle that has come to symbolise the grinding brutality of the war. Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. The Kremlin has insisted any proposals to end the conflict in Ukraine must take into account what it calls “today’s realities” of four Ukrainian regions Moscow has unilaterally declared part of Russia. In a regular briefing with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s 10-point peace plan, which includes the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. One of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head of Russia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to a Russian-installed “official”. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov.

An Australian man from Victoria died fighting in Ukraine. His mother remembered her son. She said he was a defender of freedom. He was driven by empathy. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) confirmed on Wednesday that Sage O’Donnell from Melbourne had died. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has released a count of civilian casualties in Russia's war on Ukraine. It says 6,884 people died in Ukraine between 24 February 2022 and 26 December 2022. This is 429 children. The actual figure is likely to be ""very high,"" it said. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree banning the supply of oil and oil products to countries participating in a cap on oil from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil from 5 December. Good afternoon from London, it's Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest from Ukraine. You can get in touch on Twitter or email.

"Still, Bakhmut stands. Bakhmut, which had a pre-war population of 70,000-80,000, is a ghost town now largely in ruins. The deterioration of diplomatic relations between Russia and Lithuania has continued, with the expulsion today of a Lithuanian from their embassy in Moscow. A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said: On 28 December, Chargé d’Affaires of Lithuania in Russia, Jurgita Cibulskiene was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry. The Lithuanian side was strongly protested in connection with the unjustified expulsion on 1 December this year [of an] employee of the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. As a response, one of the diplomats of the Lithuanian embassy was declared “persona non grata”, and must leave the territory of the Russian Federation within five days. Reuters reported that ship insurers have said they are cancelling war risk cover across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, after an exit from the region by reinsurers in the face of steep losses. Reinsurers, which insure the insurers, typically renew their 12-month contracts with insurance clients on 1 January, giving them the first opportunity to scale back exposure since the war in Ukraine started. The moves by the insurers will make it harder for ship-owners or charterers to find insurance, increase prices and may mean some ships sail uninsured, industry sources said. Ukraine’s first deputy minister of foreign affairs, Emine Dzheppar, has tweeted images of a maternity hospital in Kherson city that was shelled by Russian forces yesterday. According to Ukraine’s healthcare minister, Viktor Liashko, Russian forces bombed the hospital just moments after a baby was born. Two babies were born at the hospital the day of the attack, Liashko wrote on his Facebook, adding that one arrived just “minutes” before the shelling. He added: Fortunately, no babies ... no hospital staff were hurt this time. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. The European Commission says it is donating €14m (£12.3m) to buy and transport school buses for Ukraine, as well as an additional 120 buses “to bring Ukrainian children safely to school”.","Still, Bakhmut stands.

"About 5.7 million school-age children in Ukraine have been affected by Russia’s war, which has also led to thousands of schools and educational facilities damaged or destroyed, the Commission said. Authorities in the city of Odesa have begun dismantling a monument to Catherine the Great, the Russian empress who founded the city in the late 18th century. The monument was first erected in 1900 but was dismantled in 1920 after the Bolshevik takeover. It was restored and reopened in 2007. After the 2014 Maidan revolution, Ukraine’s parliament passed a “decommunisation” law that meant statues to Lenin and other Soviet political figures had to be removed (or, in the case of Odesa’s Lenin statue, reworked and reimagined as a statue to Darth Vader). Since Russia’s February invasion, however, many in Ukraine have sought a more overarching reevaluation of anything Russian, and the monument to Catherine had been daubed with red paint several times. Last month, the local parliament voted to dismantle the statue, as well as another to the Tsarist general Alexander Suvorov. Authorities plan to store the monuments in a museum in the city. France’s armed forces minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has tweeted a photo of him visiting a memorial to the war dead in Kyiv as part of his visit to Ukraine. Lecornu, who is on his first visit to Ukraine since being appointed in May, is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, and army officials.

Speaking in an interview with Il Messaggero newspaper, Crosetto said the air defence systems, which Ukraine’s president has requested, would be provided to Kyiv “if possible”. He added: If we give air defence missiles to Ukraine, we must take them from our stocks and we have to do that without depleting them, and being sure about the quality.","About 5.

"Officials have sounded the all-clear almost two hours later. There were no immediate reports of any new Russian missile strikes. Ukrainian social media suggested the nationwide alert may have been declared after Russian jets stationed in Belarus took off. Russian forces have stepped up mortar and artillery attacks on Kherson city in southern Ukraine, forcing hundreds of civilians to flee the recently liberated city amid relentless shelling by Moscow’s troops. Russian troops fired 33 rockets at civilian targets in a series of aerial and artillery bombardments in Kherson over the course of 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said this morning.

Hilliar reports that Lecornu is under pressure to announce further assistance, with some in Ukraine still angry at Macron’s comments during the course of the war, where he has seemed more vocal than most European leaders to suggest that Ukraine should be prepared to make concessions in return for peace. Reuters reports that one of President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin aides has visited the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in a part of southern Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed. Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin official responsible for overseeing Russia’s domestic politics and a former head ofRussia’s state nuclear corporation, discussed the safety of the plant, according to Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed “official” in the occupied region. In a picture published by Rogov on Telegram, Kiriyenko was seen outside the plant.","President Zelenskiy has been promoting his 10-point peace plan. It was first announced in November.

"The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has tweeted to reiterate the support the US is providing to keep energy systems running in Ukraine, following Russia’s sustained attacks on the energy infrastructure that civilians rely on. The ambassador said the embassy in Kyiv is “proud to carry out the secretary of state’s mission to work day and night with Ukrainian partners to help keep the energy grid up and running through the winter. We stand with Ukraine.” Ukraine has bought 1,400 drones, mostly for reconnaissance, and plans to develop combat models that can attack the exploding drones Russia has used during its invasion, according to the Ukrainian government minister in charge of technology. Associated Press reports that in an interview with the minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian official said: The next stage, now that we are more or less equipped with reconnaissance drones, is strike drones. These are both exploding drones and drones that fly up to 3 to 10km and hit targets. I can say already that the situation regarding drones will change drastically in February or March. To date, Ukraine has been coy about claiming that explosions reported within the borders of the Russian Federation have been down to military and drone activity. In the last few moments, authorities in Kyiv and Mykolaiv have declared air raid alerts, according to posts on Telegram. The state-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting that Russian authorities claim to have thwarted a Ukrainian-sponsored terrorist attack in Chegem in the Kabardino-Balkarian republic, which is near Russia’s border with Georgia. It reports: The federal security service stopped the activities of two previously convicted Russian citizens who, on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services, were preparing a terrorist act in the city of Chegem. After committing the crime, they planned to leave for Ukraine to take part in hostilities against the Russian armed forces. At the scene of the clash, they found an improvised explosive device with a capacity of about 2kg in TNT equivalent, an AK-74 assault rifle, a pistol and ammunition. The report states that the two suspects were killed.

The programme also provides solid fuel and cash assistance to help people have flexible winter livelihoods.

"Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says that fighting has intensified, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops who have been part of a mobilisation drive for military operations in Ukraine will have the right to get their sperm frozen for free in cryobanks, the state TASS agency reported on Wednesday. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his appeal for budgetary assistance with the plan. The ministry “determined the possibility of financial support from the federal budget for free conservation and storage of germ cells (spermatozoa) for citizens mobilised to participate in the special military operation for 2022-2024”, Trunov was quoted as saying. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance indicates they can do so. More on Russia’s response to the oil price cap, via Reuters: Under the cap, oil traders who want to retain access to Western financing for such crucial aspects of global shipping as insurance must promise not to pay above $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. That is close to the current price for Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia was able to sell it for much of the past year, when windfall energy profits helped Moscow offset the impact of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and the Kremlin website, was presented as a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would halt crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023. A separate ban on refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel would take effect on a date to be set by the government. Putin would have authority to overrule the measures in special cases. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and any actual disruption to its sales would have far-reaching consequences for global energy supplies. Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a price cap on its oil imposed by Western countries, while its forces were involved in heavy fighting around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.","Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says fighting has increased, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines.

Russia retaliated on Tuesday against a Western price cap on its oil. Its forces were also fighting in eastern Ukraine. The fighting was around the bombed-out ghost town of Bakhmut.","Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov says fighting is getting worse, according to Reuters, with Russia deploying more tanks and armoured vehicles on front lines. Russian troops mobilized for the war in Ukraine can now freeze their sperm for free. This will be done in cryobanks. Citing Igor Trunov, president of the Russian Union of Lawyers, TASS reported that the Health Ministry responded to his request for budgetary assistance with the plan. Financial support is planned for 2022, 2023, and 2024. Families can also use the stored biomaterial free of charge if their compulsory medical insurance says they can do so. Russia has responded to a price cap. The cap is set at $60 per barrel for Russian seaborne oil. Oil traders must not pay more than this price if they want to keep access to Western financing and insurance for shipping. That's close to the price of Russian oil, but far below the prices at which Russia sold it for much of the past year, when windfall profits helped Moscow offset the effects of financial sanctions. The decree from Putin, published on a government portal and on the Kremlin website, was a direct response to “actions that are unfriendly and contradictory to international law by the United States and foreign states and international organisations joining them”. The Kremlin ban would stop crude oil sales to countries participating in the price cap from 1 February to 1 July 2023.

"Despite an intensification in the fighting the frontline in eastern Ukraine remains little changed, with neither side making any major advances, said Britain’s Ministry of Defence and Ukraine military analysts. Moscow will ban oil sales to countries that abide by the price cap that was imposed on 5 December, President Vladimir Putin decreed. The price cap, unseen even in the times of the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, is aimed at crippling Moscow’s military efforts in Ukraine - without upsetting markets by actually blocking Russian supply. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has released a count of the number of civilian casualties in Russia’s war on Ukraine so far, saying that 6,884 people are known to have died in Ukraine, including 429 children, between 24 February 2022 to 26 December 2022. The agency says the actual figure is likely to be “considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree that bans the supply of oil and oil products to nations participating in an imposed cap from 1 February 2023 for five months. The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia agreed this month to a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil effective from 5 December. Ukrainian forces appear to have edged closer to recapturing the key-Russian controlled city of Kreminna in Luhansk province. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said fighters in part of the city controlled by Russian command were forced to retreat to Rubizhne, a town a few miles to the south-east, as a result of Ukrainian military pressure.","Fighting in eastern Ukraine has increased, but the frontline is still little changed.

"Pope Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, died on Saturday aged 95, three days after his successor, Pope Francis, warned the world that he was gravely ill. The Vatican announced that Francis would preside at Benedict’s funeral in St Peter’s Square on Thursday. From Monday, his body will lie at St Peter’s Basilica to allow the faithful to pay respects. Benedict’s death brings to a close an unprecedented period in recent history where two popes have coexisted, a situation that has caused tensions within rival camps in the Vatican. It eases the way for his successor, Pope Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer paid warm tribute to Benedict, referring to his 2010 visit to the UK as a historic moment. Other world leaders including Ireland’s Michael D Higgins, France’s Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Germany’s Olaf Scholz also issued tributes. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster and leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, said he was a scholar, pastor and a man of God who would be remembered for “his courtesy, his gentleness, the perceptiveness of his mind and the openness of his welcome to everybody that he met”. Justin Welby, the Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, said Benedict was “one of the greatest theologians of his age”. Earlier this week, Pope Francis announced during his weekly audience that Benedict was “very sick” and asked for people to pray for him. Benedict, born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, was a deeply conservative pontiff, whose tenure was overshadowed by sexual abuse scandals in the church. He retired leaving a chequered reputation after a papacy that was at times divisive. The son of a policeman, he grew up in rural Bavaria and at the age of 14 joined the Hitler Youth, a requirement, and served in the German army in the second world war.","Pope Benedict XVI died on Saturday.

"Towards the end of the war, he deserted and was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces. He later became a major figure in the Vatican and, as Cardinal Ratzinger, served as a right-hand man to his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. He headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a Vatican department once known as the Inquisition, for 24 years, a position that earned him the nickname “God’s rottweiler”. During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface. His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis, which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005. As well as the flood of allegations, lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests’ complicity in covering it up, the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents, many of which later appeared in an exposé of alleged corruption. In October 2012, a Vatican court convicted the pope’s personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, of stealing the papers. He told the trial he had been acting against “evil and corruption”. Benedict held uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception. He had strongly opposed liberation theology, a radical movement that began in South American in the 1960s and advocated clerical social activism among the poor and marginalised. His sudden resignation at the age of 85, in February 2013, the first pope to do so since the middle ages, left the church reeling. He said at the time that he did not have the strength to carry on as leader of the world’s estimated 1.2 billion Catholics. “I have had to recognise my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me,” he said. He took the title of Pope Emeritus, and pledged to remain “hidden to the world”, devoting himself to private prayer. He retired to in a monastery in Vatican City, where he read, wrote letters and articles, received guests and played the piano.

"As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso remembers excitedly readying himself in front of a handheld meat grinder to crush cashews. It was his part in his family’s annual tradition of preparing a 60-year-old recipe for Christmas cake that had been passed down for generations. Christmas cake – a moist, decadent treat filled with nuts and fruit – usually kicks off the holiday season on the island nation, and for immigrants in the US, has become a way to preserve traditions from back home. Sri Lanka’s Christmas cake is similar to the fruit cake, a quintessentially British dish, but has since evolved from its colonial roots. Like the British version, Christmas cake includes raisins and cherries, but also preserved ginger, the green vegetable chayote (or chow chow, as Sri Lankans call it) in sugar syrup, preserved melon (known as puhul dosi), candied peel, sultanas and aromatics like nutmeg. “It definitely has been adapted to the Sri Lankan palate,” says Cumaraiah-Misso, 34, now a medical student living in Fort Worth, Texas. He still remembers being a child and the earthy aromas of cinnamon and cardamom intermingling with the sweet smell of rose essence while being elbow-deep in a 25-gallon bucket, mixing finely chopped fruit semolina with butter. Marie Shirlene Fernando, 58, a caterer and mother of three living in Cerritos, California, remembers watching her aunt make the cake as a little girl. As a teenager, she took over the responsibility of making the stodgy treat, first for her ailing grandmother and later for her extended family to give as wedding favors. Now, she makes it with her 10-year-old granddaughter for customers across the United States. She carefully wraps the final product in parchment paper and brightly colored cellophane. This year, one of the packages will be shipped to her family in Sri Lanka.","As a child in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Oryan Cumaraiah-Misso was excitedly readying himself in front of a meat grinder to crush cashews.

"Given the country’s recent economic and political woes, she hopes the beloved dessert will help evoke unity and remind her mother, sister and extended family, of simpler times of gathering around the table to prepare the cake ingredients. In Sri Lanka, as the country’s hotels gear up for the holiday season, some host cake-mixing parties, where people get a view of culinary staff combining the fruit and nut mixture with the wet ingredients in a custom-built, 9ft-deep barrel. The mix weighs more than 4,000lb. This year, one even took place aboard a naval ship. Fernando said she was watching the Galle Face Hotel’s recent Christmas cake mixing ceremony and thought to herself, “Oh, I’m so glad in spite of all that’s going on, they are still doing it.” These traditions were in jeopardy this year as the nation battled its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948. Government corruption, financial mismanagement, sluggish economic growth since the pandemic, the depletion of foreign reserves and the war in Ukraine led to widespread blackouts, shortages of essential goods and school closures earlier this year. Islandwide protests ultimately led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the resignation of his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister. Inflation hit an all-time high of 69.8% in October before dropping slightly to 61% in November. While Fernando is hopeful that the nostalgia of Christmas cake-making will provide some joy to celebrations, Cumaraiah-Misso worries about how the increased prices of ingredients will affect this longstanding tradition. On local Facebook groups, bakers lament the rising cost of ingredients, with some commenting that they have chosen not to make the treat this year and are readying themselves for an “austere Christmas”. In a country ravaged by a 30-year civil war fought on ethnic lines and where, in 2019, at least 290 people died as bombs ripped through three churches on Easter Sunday, Christmas cake can unite across religions.

"They love the Christmas cake, and they wait for a piece of Christmas cake,” Fernando said. She recalls them asking, “Where is my share? Did you keep me a piece?” Indrika Arnold, a wealth adviser in Lebanon, New Hampshire, has found another set of fans for her Christmas cake: her American co-workers. “I have some colleagues at work with whom I shared a piece, and they loved it. Now, they always ask, ‘When are you making your spice cake?’” she said. “I even mail it to some of my friends who no longer work with me.” She only made a half recipe when she started making Christmas cake five years ago. Now she’s doubled it. Arnold moved to the US 22 years ago but only started making the rich cake – as it’s known at other times of year – to share the tradition with her 12-year-old daughter. She has core memories of sitting around the kitchen table with her siblings and parents, cutting the preserved fruit into small pieces, and sneaking bits of raisins and cashews into her mouth when no one was looking. “A week or two before Thanksgiving, I get all the ingredients, and we actually get together as a family and cut it and we all take turns mixing the booze and the honey,” she said about how she continues this tradition with her daughter and husband in the US. She then leaves the fruits to stew in the alcohol mixture for at least two weeks, kick starting the holidays in their home. Like Arnold, Fernando also plans to gather around the table with her granddaughter to finely chop the fruit, which will then be soaked in a brandy mixture for one day. “By making it every Christmas, it has become a part of celebrating Christmas as Sri Lankans overseas,” Fernando said.","They love the Christmas cake and they wait for a piece of Christmas cake,"" Fernando said.

"Father Happy Jacob has a reason to be cheerful. When he started St Thomas’s Indian Orthodox Church in Liverpool in 2002, his congregation numbered about 60 families, and stayed at that level for almost two decades. Then, a few years ago, things began to change. “We have seen a massive increase in families coming to the church,” says Jacob, 48. At his last count, there were 110 families, with worshippers including NHS workers, international students and about 100 school-age children. This story is being repeated across Britain. From Liverpool to London, Preston to Bristol, church congregations are being bolstered by Indian Christians. Most are from southern states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where Christianity is strong. Many have recently moved to the UK. The boom is in sharp contrast to the national trend. According to the latest census, Christianity is in decline in England and Wales: the portion of the population describing itself as Christian has fallen from 59.3% in 2011 to 46.2% in 2021. But the number of Indian Christians has surged over the same period. While they remain a small portion of the total number – about 27.5 million –who say they are Christian, the Indian contingent rose from 135,988 in 2011 to 225,935 in 2021, the fastest rise of any ethnic group. “There are lots and lots of Christians coming from India,” says Rev Joshva Raja of the British and Foreign Bible Society. As well as boosting dedicated Indian churches, the new arrivals are contributing particularly to Catholic congregations, but Raja says: “I see some of the Anglican churches growing too.” Some of those arriving grew up as part of protestant denominations that were founded in India after it gained independence in 1947. NHS worker Pradeep George, 42, secretary at the Church of South India in East Ham, east London, says the number of families attending has doubled since before Covid to about 80. Services are quite similar to Church of England ones, with hymns, bible readings and a few twists, such as plum cake – popular in Kerala. Jacob’s church in Liverpool is part of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian church, also known as Indian Orthodox, which traces its origins to the arrival of Saint Thomas in India in 52 AD.","Father Happy Jacob has a reason to be happy.

"The church’s weekly “energetic gathering” lasts about two hours and is usually held in Malayalam, Kerala’s official language. Afterwards, people stay to socialise for much of the day, sharing foods such as appam – fluffy rice pancakes – lamb biryani or croissants with tea. There is also a Sunday school with about 100 pupils. Over Christmas, carol singers from St Thomas’s run a door-to-door service in Liverpool, Chester and beyond, visiting all the families from the congregation. This weekend, dressed in Christmas jumpers, they were in the living room of Suriya Varghese, 37, and her husband Anup Cherian, 40, who recently started attending the church with their three children. The Keralan family had been living in Qatar before moving to the UK last year after both parents got jobs as electrical design engineers for the same company. Their involvement with the church extends far beyond Sunday services. Their children – Abner, 10, Anika, 7, and Arush, 4 – attend the Sunday school, where Suriya teaches. They had help from the church network with everything from finding housing and applying for driving licences to coping with UK weather and picking trustworthy handymen. “The church plays a very big role in our lives,” says Anup. “This is about being part of the community, especially for the kids.” For Ephrem Sam Mattappallil and his friends, the support afforded by the church community has also been a lifeline. Mattappallil, 25, who moved to London last year to study, runs a support group for students within the Indian Orthodox Church, many of whom are “struggling”. Last year, it helped about 120 people. “Our parents, relatives and friends are not here, and there is financial pressure as well,” Mattappallil says. “Through the church, we can find a lot of friends, and share our experiences. It helped me a lot.” Elsewhere, Indian Christians are finding community in mainstream churches. At the Catholic church of St Osmund in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Father Jonathan Creer has been “surprised” and “delighted” by the trend.","The weekly “energy gathering” of the church lasts about two hours and is usually held in Malayalam, Kerala’s official language. After that, people stay to socialise for a long time. They share food like appam, which are fluffy rice pancakes, and they also share lamb biryani or croissants with tea. There is also a Sunday school with about 100 pupils.

"He said that in the past two years, mass attendance has been boosted by a “huge increase in the Indian community”, many of whom work at the local NHS hospital. The Indian families also include large numbers of children, teenagers and 20-somethings, who seem to have a more positive attitude to religion than some of their young British counterparts, he says. The increase has been particularly noticeable since the Covid lockdowns. “Some of our congregation – mostly older, white people – have still not come back, and some of them died, so it’s very noticeable now, looking out at mass, that we have many Asian and other faces,” Creer said. “It’s quite surprising in Salisbury, because you walk around the streets and it seems almost a mono-ethnic place, but actually, that’s not true.” He said that despite what some might think, the new arrivals had been really welcomed with open arms. “You might imagine that in a rather staid, middle-England place like Salisbury, people might wonder what was going on, but they have been delighted.” One way the congregation has embraced the Indian newcomers is by embracing a tradition observed in Kerala of passing around a “quite large” statue of the Virgin Mary, with a different worshipper taking it home each week. “People were very enthused about that,” Creer said. At other churches, Indian Christians have found themselves in the minority. Arun Vedhanayagam Selwyn, from Chennai in Tamil Nadu, began attending the Anglican St John the Baptist church in Eltham, south-east London, after moving to the UK last year. “It’s mostly people from the local area at services,” he says. “It’s very rare to see another person from India.” At 25, the master’s student at Greenwich university is also much younger than most of the other worshippers. “Mostly it’s old age people here,” he says. “Whereas in India, people from different age categories come to the church.” Nevertheless, he has found the community “very welcoming”.

"It was 4am on a Monday and most of Rio de Janeiro was asleep. But in the Morro do 77, a favela on the gritty westside of town, the party was just getting under way as hundreds of revellers packed the community’s main thoroughfare to strut their stuff before a three-metre (10ft) wall of sound. Speakers and subwoofers pumped ear-shattering favela funk music into the dawn air. Partygoers drank pint-sized cups of whiskey and frozen coconut water. And as heads bobbed, bodies twerked and window panes shook, the rave’s unexpected name flashed up on a screen above the dancefloor in a distinctly British blaze of red, blue and white. “The Baile de Londres,” it said. “The Party of London.” “Sometimes people go straight to work afterwards,” said one of the DJs, Hyago Domingos de Lima, before his deafening setlist rendered conversation impossible. The Sunday night blowout – during which partygoers, including one wearing an England football shirt, danced until 7am – is one of scores of favela funk parties now named after cities and countries around the world. The trend began about five years ago when musicians in one of Rio’s largest favelas, the Complexo do Lins, founded the Baile da Colombia (the Party of Colombia), a reference to the Brazilian neighbour’s long-running conflict and the deadly violence that also blights many gang-controlled areas in Rio. Sensing a foreign name could increase their brand profile and attract larger audiences, event organisers in favelas across the city reached for their maps. In Chapadão they named their event after Egypt, in Parque das Missões, Poland, and in Parque Arará, Portugal. One favela opted for China and used the Chinese national flag to advertise its rave. Another chose Japan, in homage to a local gangster nicknamed after the east-Asian country. In São Gonçalo, a satellite city to Rio’s east, promoters picked US cities, including New York, Brooklyn and Las Vegas.","It was 4am on Monday and most of Rio de Janeiro was asleep.

"In Rocinha they celebrated Russia with the Baile de Moscow. In Jacarezinho they created the Baile de Paris. “I think there’s one named after every single country in the world,” said Kaio Gonçalves da Silva. The 26-year-old DJ plays at funk parties named after Acapulco and Saudi Arabia in Duque de Caxias, a city to Rio’s north. On his customised Sonic the Hedgehog motorbike, it takes him five minutes to get between the two gigs. “There the Party of Canada. There’s Libya. There’s Korea … There’s Croatia. There’s Sweden. I think there’s an Italy one too … There’s Ireland. There’s Scotland,” said Da Silva, AKA DJ Kaio VDM, the composer of a recent hit celebrating the Brazil and West Ham footballer Lucas Paquetá. Luiz Júnior, a DJ and producer from a westside favela called Vila Aliança, said that by the time the area’s musicians decided to adopt a country, “there were hardly any left”. So they plumped for Romania. “To be honest, I don’t know anything about Romania. Lots of people here don’t even know what the capital is … [But] people really liked the colour of the flag,” said Júnior, whose sound system, Ignorant, rents out massive custom-made speaker systems to parties including Argentina, Mexico and Iraq. Lima, whose DJ name is HG, came up with the Baile de Londres while shooting the breeze in Morro do 77’s main square with his friends Fatty Psycho, Haze, Xiclaudio and Big Dave. At first they considered Guatemala. Then someone floated England. But the Portuguese word for England (Inglaterra) had too many syllables and was a mouthful for MCs, he said. So they opted for the Baile de Londres and a new UK-themed Rio rave was born, with fliers featuring pictures of of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. Lima, who like most of the favela’s residents has never travelled abroad, admitted his knowledge of the UK capital was patchy.","In Rocinha they celebrated Russia with the Baile de Moscow.

"“When I think of London I think of … all those big buildings and that lake with the bridge over it,” he said of Tower Bridge. Marcelo Henrique dos Anjos da Silva, a dancer whose mesmerising dance steps at the Baile de Londres often go viral social media, associated London with little but the cold. “It’s the sort of place you need a jacket and a scarf,” Da Silva, whose nickname is ML, said as he sat in Morro do 77’s plaza in flip-flops and shorts. The creation of the Party of London has given the Brazilian favela a curiously British feel. The main street, Francisco Brício Avenue, has been informally renamed the Retão de Londres, which roughly translates as London Street. Last year a local football team was founded: the Seleção de Londres or Team London. In true English style, they made it to the final of the favela’s annual tournament but then lost. “They thrashed us: 4-0 or something,” said Pedro Gomes, one of the team’s defenders, as he showed off the favela’s synthetic pitch wearing his union-flag-branded kit. Gomes, who works in a hospital pharmacy when not protecting London’s goal, said the baile was an essential form of leisure for overburdened residents of his deprived neighbourhood. “It’s a way locals have off enjoying themselves when all they do is work, work, work. People need to have fun too,” the 25-year-old said as the event’s giant sound system was assembled behind him outside the evangelical church Vida Em Graça (Life in Grace). Rio’s funk scene has long been criminalised and vilified by authorities and critics who accuse it of glorifying drugs, guns and sex, although in recent years the movement has been widely recognised as a culture treasure and even celebrated in one of Brazil’s top art museums. The parties are also a crucial economic lifeline for Rio’s favelas, which are home to about 20% of the city’s population.","""When I think of London I think of ... all those big buildings and that lake with the bridge over it,"" he said of Tower Bridge.

"Twenty-four hours before the Baile de Londres kicked off, Adriana da Silva Lucena set off from her home in the Vila Ideal favela to sell drinks at the Baile de Acapulco. “Our lives are tough and if it wasn’t for the baile lots of people would be going hungry,” said Lucena, a 51-year-old single-mother in an area where many families depend on benefits. “It’s tiring. It’s stressful … When you get home you’re dead after working all night,” she said of her nocturnal shifts. “But I love this community.

Outsiders just don’t get it at all.” Moments later, the volume was cranked up and partiers began to arrive for a night of unbroken hedonism.

"Production was suspended at the last operating domestic factory of Japanese automaker Daihatsu on Tuesday, as the Toyota subsidiary grapples with a safety testing scandal affecting 64 models going back more than three decades. Issues with falsified crash tests first came to light in April, when the firm admitted it had manipulated data on four models manufactured in Thailand and Malaysia from 2022 until this year. The company has since acknowledged that similar issues have occurred across almost its entire production process, with an internal investigation discovering falsified data dating back to 1989. “We betrayed the trust of our customers,” said Daihatsu CEO Soichiro Okudaira at a Tokyo press conference last week. “All the blame is on the management.” On 20 December the company announced it would halt shipments of all models while further investigations and safety checks are carried out. Initial investigations have found that the shortening of vehicle development time was likely the main cause of corners being cut on safety checks. Head of the investigating panel Makoto Kaiami said, “There was tremendous pressure on employees as altering sales schedules due to test failures was widely seen as unacceptable.” Daihatsu identified doors that can become difficult to open from the outside after an accident as the major safety issue, though there have been no reports of related injuries. Included in the 64 models are vehicles manufactured by Daihatsu under contract for Toyota, Mazda and Subaru. Production is currently set to be suspended at its factories across Japan until at least the end of January, affecting 9,000 workers and more than 8,000 suppliers. Daihatsu produced about 870,000 vehicles in Japan last year, a supply chain worth approximately 2.2tn yen (US$15bn). Daihatsu, which was founded in Osaka in 1907 and taken over by Toyota in 1967, is currently negotiating with unions and suppliers over compensation while production remains suspended. Although Japanese cars are known for their safety and reliability, the industry has been hit by numerous scandals over the years. In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors finally confessed to covering up defects in its vehicles dating back to 1977, after partially admitting to related problems four years earlier. Similar issues then emerged at its subsidiary Fuso Truck and Bus in what became one of Japan’s worst corporate scandals.","Production stopped at Daihatsu's last domestic factory on Tuesday.

"Before the arrival of Lundin Oil in the town of Leer, now part of South Sudan, life there was peaceful, says George Tai Kuony. His childhood was that of a “typical village boy”, driving cattle, helping his family and going to school. But in June 1998, when he was 15, armed forces entered the town and changed his life for ever. He fled, became separated from his family and hid for seven days before he was able to return. “When we got there, Leer wasn’t the town I had left seven days ago,” says the 40-year-old lawyer and human rights defender. “Everything was burned down, everything was destroyed. I could see the bodies of dead people lying in the street.” As a result of the conflict, he lost his father, and later his mother and one sibling. At the time, he says, the community had no idea why people were fighting. They had never heard of the Swedish oil company. Now, a quarter of a century later, Kuony hopes that he and the other victims will get justice as two former executives of the company go on trial in Stockholm accused of aiding and abetting war crimes in Sudan between 1999 and 2003. In Sweden’s largest-ever trial, Ian Lundin, a Swede, and Alex Schneiter, who is Swiss, stand accused of asking Sudan’s government to make its army and allied militia responsible for security at one of Lundin Oil’s exploration fields. This led to aerial bombings, civilian killings and the burning of entire villages, according to the prosecution. Both men deny the charges. The trial, which follows a decade-long investigation, hundreds of interviews and an 80,000-page report by the prosecution, started in September. But its most significant moments are expected in 2024, when 61 witnesses – including victims, Lundin employees, former UN staff and high-profile politicians – are due to appear. They include Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister, who sat on the company’s board for five years until becoming the country’s foreign minister. “My life has never been the same,” says Kuony, speaking to the Observer from South Sudan’s capital, Juba, where he now lives.","Before Lundin Oil arrived in Leer, now part of South Sudan, life was peaceful, says George Tai Kuony.

"“Oil came to our area: it should have been a blessing. It should have been for the benefit of the community.” Instead, there was “a massacre. They wanted us dead. They wanted us to go away.” Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006, when the group unsuccessfully sought redress at a court in Sudan. He hopes the trial, whatever its outcome, will set a new legal precedent for global corporations working in foreign jurisdictions, sending a “very strong message” that they cannot act with impunity. “That one day they will be prosecuted in the same way.” But the victims have already been dealt a significant blow. Ebony Wade, a legal adviser at Stockholm-based human rights organisation Civil Rights Defenders, said Stockholm district court’s decision in November to separate the plaintiffs’ damage claims from the criminal trial would make it “significantly harder” – if not impossible – to have their cases heard, and would considerably delay the justice process. While the plaintiffs’ testimonies were still expected to be included in the criminal trial, she said, this could push the civil claims back until the criminal trial was over, which would not be until February 2026. However, May 2024 will be a historic moment: for the first time the court will hear the experiences of plaintiffs and victims from South Sudan. “It’s incredibly rare for corporate executives to be held accountable for grave human rights violation,” says Wade. “For the first time, the leadership of a multinational company is being put on trial in a European country on allegations that they were complicit in war crimes in the conduct of their business activities.” She adds: “There are very few opportunities for victims of grave international crimes to seek redress, so in that sense this is an incredibly important trial.” Rev James Ninrew Dong, of the Presbyterian Church in South Sudan, fled Leer after religious buildings were targeted. The priest, who is a witness and a plaintiff in the case, said he felt compelled to testify: “They attacked us. They displaced us. What made me sorry is that people came to the church seeking safety and were not able to get it.

It should have been for the benefit of the community.” Instead, there was “a massacre. They wanted us dead. They wanted us to go away.” Kuony has been trying to get justice since 2006, when the group failed to get a fair trial in Sudan. He hopes the trial will set a new legal precedent. This is for global corporations working in foreign countries. It would be very strong. They can't do it without them. This is true no matter what the trial is. “That one day they will be prosecuted in the same way.” But the victims have already been dealt a significant blow. Ebony Wade is a lawyer at Civil Rights Defenders. This human rights organisation is in Stockholm. She said a court decision in November would separate damage claims from the criminal trial. This would make it much harder to hear the cases. It would also delay the justice process. While the plaintiffs' testimony was still expected to be included in the criminal trial, she said, this could delay the civil claims until the criminal trial is over, which would not be until February 2026. However, May 2024 will be a historic moment: for the first time the court will hear the experiences of plaintiffs and victims from South Sudan. “It’s incredibly rare for corporate executives to be held accountable for grave human rights violation,” says Wade. Company leaders are accused of being complicit in war crimes. ""There are very few opportunities for victims of serious international crimes to get a fair trial, so this is a very important trial.""

"Accusations are growing that the former Sri Lankan government, led by strongman president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blocked an investigation into the country’s worst terrorist attack amid claims that they had helped orchestrate the blasts in order to return to power. In the attacks on Easter Sunday in 2019, six suicide bombers targeted churches and luxury hotels across the country, killing 269 people, including eight British tourists. But almost five years on, an investigation has failed to provide any answers for how the attacks took place and the security failures that led up to them. So far, there have been no criminal convictions. Instead, people previously involved in the investigation, and the leader of Sri Lanka’s Catholic church, have alleged that inquiries were repeatedly sabotaged and obstructed by the Rajapaksa government. In a recent documentary for Channel 4’s Dispatches, a whistleblower alleged that the attacks were part of a plan to create instability in Sri Lanka and ensure that Rajapaksa, a member of Sri Lanka’s most powerful political family, would win the presidential elections in 2019. The source said he had helped an intelligence officer with close ties to the Rajapaksa family meet members of the local Islamist militant group, National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ), that carried out the attack. He said it had been part of a plan that had been hatched over a couple of years to create an “unsafe” security situation that would help bring Rajapaksa to power. The Rajapaksa family had ruled Sri Lanka for almost a decade from 2005. They were credited with ending its bloody, 26-year-long civil war but became notorious for their authoritarian methods, including the use of “death squads” to target critics and journalists. Mahinda Rajapaksa was ousted in 2015 after a backlash against alleged corruption, but the family had planned a return to power in the 2019 election, this time with younger brother Gotabaya as the presidential candidate. He won the election but was toppled dramatically from power in July last year, after the country experienced a catastrophic economic crisis, and replaced by Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is seen as close to the Rajapaksa family.","The accusations are growing against the former Sri Lankan government.

"Ravi Seneviratne, the former director general of police who initially led the Easter attacks investigation, told the Observer that after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected president, the government had “prevented the investigation”. He said his team had already “established links” between state and military intelligence officers and the NTJ suicide bombers. He said that the investigations had also led him to believe there was someone higher up helping to coordinate the attack who had yet to be apprehended. However, when Rajapaksa took office, Seneviratne’s entire team at CID was taken off the case. More than 20 of his officers were transferred without his approval and travel bans were imposed on all 700 CID officers. “The motive was to make them too scared to send a message. Many were too scared to work and some people even applied for transfers out of CID,” he said. Since then, Seneviratne claims there have been several attempts to “keep me quiet”. The targeting of those involved in the investigation took a murkier turn this month after the attorney general told the courts that there had been a conspiracy to murder Shani Abeysekara, the former head of Sri Lanka’s CID, who was overseeing the investigation before he was suddenly removed when the Rajapaska government came to power.

"The US government has announced the release of what it said was its last available package of weapons available for Ukraine, with Congress needing to decide on future support. According to the state department, it is worth up to $250m and includes air defence munitions and components, Himars ammunition, 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition, anti-armour munitions, and over 15m rounds of ammunition. The war in 2024 “must be different from 2023”, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces has said. “Otherwise we will face what I wrote about in the article [the Economist]”, said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi. “Unfortunately, I must state that the enemy is not far behind us. In recent days, we have had a powerful confrontation applying modern technologies. But we do not spare efforts. My main mistake was that I thought that the amount of losses we inflicted on the enemy would stop anyone. But not the Russian Federation.” Zaluzhnyi, giving a press conference, said Ukrainian troops remained on a defensive line in the northern part of Maryinka. “But I can say that this settlement no longer exists. The [Russian] method is the same as it was in Bakhmut. Street by street, block by block are destroyed. The fact that we have now moved to the outskirts of Maryinka, and in some places equipped positions beyond Maryinka, seems to me to be nothing that can cause a public outcry.” “As for the conduct of hostilities around Avdiivka,” he continued, “there is no need to dwell on it and make a show of it. The conduct of hostilities is subject to the laws of war, and they are not subject to what politicians or journalists want. The enemy now has the opportunity to concentrate forces; they can do to the city in two or three months what they have done to Bakhmut.” Two people were killed in Russian drone attacks on Odesa, according to figures from the Odesa oblast governor, Oleh Kiper. A 17-year-old was among the wounded and remained in hospital.

"Shelling by Russian forces on Tuesday had “badly damaged” the infrastructure of the city, he said, adding that it was “difficult” to say when repairs would be completed. A railway station was attacked as a train was set to evacuate residents, killing one police officer and injuring four people.

Poland is getting closer to ending the truck driver blockades of several border crossings with Ukraine, says the country’s prime minister, Donald Tusk. Polish drivers have been blocking several crossings with Ukraine since 6 November, demanding the EU reinstate a system whereby Ukrainian companies need permits and the same for European truckers to enter Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held talks in Moscow with his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and said progress had been made on plans for Russia and India to jointly produce military equipment. Jaishankar added that he expected Vladimir Putin and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to meet next year. Russia says its newest howitzers will be deployed “soon” against Ukrainian forces. The head of the state-owned defence conglomerate Rostec, Sergei Chemezov, told the RIA news agency that testing of the new self-propelled artillery units, named Coalition-SV, had been completed and mass production had started, with the pilot batch to be delivered by the end of this year.

"Just after 3 o’clock, the children start running towards the Arab-Jewish community centre. The activities are about to begin – though this is not the reason for their haste. Moments before, sirens wailed across Tel Aviv and Jaffa, warning of another rocket attack. Some cry out in fear as the metal shutters of the centre rattle down. Ten minutes later, after two loud booms signal that the rockets launched from Gaza have been destroyed in the air, the children file out of the malodorous basement of the centre and head for gym class, music lessons and a crafts session organised by an NGO that is trying to improve relations between Israel’s Jewish and Arab populations. Even the most enthusiastic of Standing Together’s activists and leaders admit that, after 11 weeks of war, the moment is inauspicious for such initiatives. “These are extreme times. People are still processing the Hamas attack and the war in Gaza. People are in survival mode and thinking in black and white,” said Nadav Shofet, Standing Together’s lead community organiser in Tel Aviv and Jaffa. One slender reason for hope is sharp rise in volunteers since the war began, members of the NGO say. Since the Hamas attacks in southern Israel in October, which killed 1,200 people, mainly civilians, thousands have joined the organisation. During the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed about 18,000 people, mostly women and children, and destroyed swaths of the territory, more have come forward to work with the group. “People are looking for a solution … It might seem crazy now but it’s clear the only way out is peace,” said Shofet. Outside the community centre, overlooking a sweep of beach and the Mediterranean, the municipal authorities have hung a banner bearing the slogan: “Together, all Jaffa’s residents will get through this”. Inside, a menorah for the Jewish festival of Hanukkah stands alongside a Christmas tree. The combination of rain and rockets means about only six children have turned up for the crafts session organised by Standing Together.

"Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, in our family we don’t make a difference. There is no victory if this is not a country for all of us,” she said. Palestinian citizens of Israel comprise 21% of the population, often living in cities where they are a majority. Jaffa, with its mixed community, has attracted many young Jewish families in recent years, many with progressive views who feel out of step with the rightwards trend of Israeli society in general. This has led to sharp increases in property prices, which have forced out often poorer Arab residents. Tammuz admitted that neither Jaffa nor the crafts class was very representative of Israel, particularly at the moment. “Here, this is like being in a small bubble but we hope it will become bigger, or I don’t see any solution,” she said. Other activities run by Standing Together include food distributions to families experiencing economic hardship, renovating public bomb shelters and a series of well-attended rallies. The organisation, founded in 2016, has also set up an unarmed joint Arab-Jewish “civil guard” to protect all communities and alert police in the event of violence. The goal of many efforts was simply to bring members of different communities together, said Amir Badran, an organiser in Jaffa for Standing Together and a local politician and lawyer. This includes the popular children’s craft sessions, held every week for two months. “Although people are in big distress, they would still prefer to get together … We don’t want the kids to be afraid of each other and hate each other. Here, they get to know each other and the parents get to meet,” Badran said. Quite how difficult finding the common ground that Standing Together seeks is clear to almost everyone in Israel. The government is the most rightwing in the country’s history, including politicians accused of “inflammatory rhetoric” before the current conflict. Though there have been no major outbreaks of violence, relations between the Jewish majority and citizens who are Arab, many of whom now identify as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are tense. “At times of war people become more radical, and [the right] is using this war to incite against Palestinian citizens,” said Rula Daood, Standing Together’s co-director.","Arabs, Muslims, Christians, Jews, in our family we don’t make a difference.

"“Whether you are a regular, public or political figure, if you say anything that isn’t a call for revenge or wiping out Gaza, you are seen as part of the enemy now. Writing ‘May God have mercy on Gaza, children in Gaza’ – that’s enough to get you targeted.” Since the attacks on 7 October, a series of prominent Arab Israelis have been arrested. In October, the singer Dalal Abu Amneh was arrested briefly after posting “there is no victor but Allah” alongside a Palestinian flag on Facebook. Some of the community’s most prominent political leaders were held after planning an anti-war protest. Standing Together has set up a hotline “to give people a place, Palestinian or Jews, to turn to” if they are being harassed. A recent poll found nearly 60% of Arab Israelis were afraid of being harassed and 10% had personal experience of harassment. Daood said: “This is a real setback in Israeli society, especially Jewish society. The pain people are living in and the terror they have had since 7 October … It has basically blinded people and people are beginning to lose their own humanity. “We have had so many bad moments, maybe this is the most traumatic, but we have been able to rise up after each and every incident before. We are trying to show there is still another path and another way.” Among the people watching the children making finger puppets and posters in Jaffa was Vera Deek, an Arab Christian former teacher. “We believe in coexistence … that’s why I brought my daughter here. But [the problem] is not with the children,” Deek said. “It’s very difficult to be here, trying to live a normal life, when so many people have died or are still dying.” Many Arab citizens of Israel have lost friends and relatives in Gaza but also in the attacks on 7 October. Some of the first deaths reported were four people who died when a rocket fired from Gaza hit a Bedouin village in the Negev desert. Arab Israelis responding to the ground offensive, including paramedics, were also killed by Hamas.

"There was a familiar sense of misery for many travellers in the week before Christmas as hundreds of trains were cancelled, motorways were closed and ferry passengers queued for miles waiting to board their ships. But it doesn’t have to be this way, transport campaigners say, as politicians and transport bosses have the power to ease some of the problems facing travellers. There is more gloom to come in the short term, according to the RAC, with Boxing Day traffic surging, and the prospect of dangerous winds in Scotland and northern England. Around 21 million people drove to visit family or friends before Christmas, and thousands more took flights or trains as what has become known as the great Christmas getaway gained momentum. Storm Pia caused disruption to rail and road in Scotland and northern England on Wednesday. Eurostar workers in France took industrial action the following day, and the knock-on effect was huge demand for ferry services. Motorists queued for 90 minutes during peak times. Saturday was expected to be the busiest day of the year on the roads, according to the RAC and Inrix, with 20% more car journeys than last Christmas weekend. On Boxing Day they expect drivers on the M25 to face 50-minute delays, and on 27 December journeys in busy areas of the UK will be 25% longer. On Saturday Port of Dover Travel reported a 90-minute wait at French border controls as traffic built up after a surge in ferry bookings in the wake of Thursday’s Eurotunnel disruption. And the Met Office is warning of high winds in Scotland, northern England and north Wales today, with possible power cuts and flying debris. Even though the weather may be out of the control of ministers and rail chiefs, they have other ways of easing the burden on travellers, according to the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and the Clean Cities Campaign (CCC). National Highways removed 1,000 miles of roadworks on 19 December – “an early Christmas present” for drivers during the festive getaway. They will be back on 2 January. Widespread engineering works are planned for the rail network, although Network Rail said it was carrying out less work than usual, and no trains run on Christmas Day. In London, Paddington station is shut until Wednesday for HS2 works, while King’s Cross is shut today and Victoria station is not running Southeastern services until 2 January.","Many travellers felt like they were in the same trouble in the week before Christmas.

"And passengers will be gambling with services by operators such as Avanti West Coast, which cut services in December and has seen 32% of services cancelled or severely delayed. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Michael Solomon Williams, CBT campaigns manager. “It’s not rational any more to distinguish between commuter travel and leisure travel.” Since the pandemic, fewer people travel during the week, he said. “People work weekends, go to football matches. There are all sorts of reasons why we need more services at weekends and Christmas, when people travel around the country more than any other time. “Another time makes more sense, like the second week of January, or on a Monday, for example.” He added that another balm for travellers would be the creation of Great British Railways, announced by the government in May 2021 but mothballed in October 2022. And passengers are being told to pay an extra 4.9% on rail fares in the new year. “They could have frozen fares the way they have with fuel duty for the last 13 years,” Solomon Williams said. “The cost of travelling by train has gone up at twice the rate of driving.” Oliver Lord, head of CCC, said that disrupting services on the busiest travel days of the year meant people were more likely to choose to take the car, adding to congestion. “A third of rail use now is on leisure,” he said. “If the three or four times a year a family wants to use trains to get out of town, and their experience is engineering works, a rail replacement bus service and journeys that take three times as long, what will they think? “It’s a great opportunity for the government to make a strategic decision,” Lord added. “If we said the first week or two of January was a time when businesses and corporations could do things a bit differently, with more working from home, that would be a great new year’s resolution from the government.” Travellers who have faced cancellations or delays should make sure they claim compensation, said Naomi Leach, deputy editor of Which?

"A person has died in Scotland after falling ill with E coli, in what appears to be the first death linked to an outbreak that has affected at least 30 people. The UK Health Security Agency said the death “has been associated with this outbreak” and added later that it occurred in Scotland, but was unable to provide more information about the case. The agency said that as of 27 December there had been 30 confirmed cases in England and Scotland linked to an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing E coli (Stec), which first emerged in July. The cases involved children as young as seven and those aged up to 81, and most cases had occurred in December. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland announced a precautionary recall of four cheeses made by Mrs Kirkham’s Lancashire Cheese on Christmas Eve due to possible E coli contamination. It added a fifth product, which is sold by Waitrose, to the recall list on 27 December. “Epidemiological and food chain investigations have identified links between some of the identified cases and a number of unpasteurised cheeses produced by a business in England,” the agency said. “UKHSA is continuing to follow up cases to identify any common links, including determining whether cases ate or came into contact with the recalled cheeses.” The products affected by the recall are: Mrs Kirkham’s Mild &amp; Creamy Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Tasty Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Mature Lancashire; Mrs Kirkham’s Smoked Lancashire; and No 1 Waitrose and Partners, Farmhouse Kirkham’s Lancashire cheese.

"The Middle East has been slipping towards the precipice of a regional war ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the ferocious Israeli response in Gaza. The past week has shown how the cliff edge keeping it from that abyss could quickly crumble away. Within hours of the outbreak of the Gaza war, the Hezbollah Shia militia in Lebanon began to fire on northern Israeli towns and villages in solidarity with Palestinians, triggering Israeli air strikes in response, and Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea with real or perceived Israeli connections. The US moved two aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups to the region as American bases in Syria and Iraq came under repeated attacks from Iran-affiliated groups, drawing swift retaliation from Washington. At the same time the West Bank erupted in protests at the bombing of civilians in Gaza and extremist Jewish settlers quickly sought to ride the wave of Israeli anger by seizing Palestinian land and terrorising its residents. Each of these theatres of conflict has the potential to ignite a much-feared Middle East conflagration, and the past few days have demonstrated just how easily escalation, intended or not, could bring Israel into open confrontation with Iran, and suck in the US too. An Israeli airstrike just outside Damascus killed a senior figure in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for military liaison between Syria and Iran. After Mousavi’s death last Monday, the IRGC issued a statement declaring the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”. Tehran’s Houthi allies have meanwhile have been firing on the US-led “Prosperity Guardian” naval task force assembled to protect shipping in the Red Sea. American warships shot down dozens of drones and also a handful of ballistic missiles. US Central Command issued a statement to say that Washington had “every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran”.","The Middle East is in the precipice of a regional war since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the fierce Israeli response in Gaza.

"If a US warship is struck, Joe Biden would be under intense pressure to deliver a decisive response, as he enters an election year with his tenure hanging in the balance and Republicans looking to focus on any trace of weakness. On Thursday, a former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, wrote a commentary in a US newspaper expressing the view of many on the hawkish end of the security establishments in both the Israel and the US that they are doomed to fight Iranian proxies indefinitely until Iran is taken on directly. “The evil empire of Iran must be brought down,” Bennett argued in the Wall Street Journal. “The US and Israel must set the clear goal of bringing down Iran’s evil regime. Not only is this possible. It is vital for the safety and security of the Middle East – and the entire civilised world.” On Friday, the UN security council convened to discuss violence on the West Bank, but the session was quickly drawn into a discussion of a regional war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, dismissed the issue of settler violence in the West Bank as a distraction from the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon. “The situation in northern Israel is reaching a point of no return,” Erdan said, echoing an increasingly frequent warning from Israeli officials that their country would take matters into its own hands, possibly by carving out a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. “If these attacks continue, I reiterate the situation will escalate and may lead to a full-scale war. Lebanon must be held accountable for the aggression carried out from its territory,” the Israeli envoy said. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, a UN assistant secretary-general, told security council members that, while most of the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been around the border, some strikes were going deeper into each other’s territory, “raising the spectre of an uncontained conflict with devastating consequences for the people of both countries”. Khiari added that “the risk of miscalculation and further escalation is increasing as the conflict in Gaza continues”.","A US warship is struck.

"Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, expressed the uneasiness of the Arab world that in the absence of “bold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions” to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, “the alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East”. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, the UN estimates that 304 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including 79 children, along with four Israelis, three of them soldiers. Four more Israelis were killed in West Jerusalem in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on 30 November. One of the dead was mistakenly shot by an Israeli soldier. The disproportionate number of Palestinian dead showed that Israeli forces have been conducting an overkill campaign in an effort to deter an uprising in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza, argued Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “The Israeli mindset is that they think they are preventing a third Intifada,” Elgindy said. “But I think the way they’re operating, they’re probably more like causing one.” He pointed to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a particularly volatile element in the combustible state of the region. Overwhelmingly blamed by Israelis for the security lapses that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, Netanyahu faces a fall from power, but only when the fighting ends, or at least lessens in intensity. An escalation, on the other hand, could keep him in his post. “It is Netanyahu, frankly, who is dictating the terms on all fronts – in Gaza, on the Lebanon border, across the region – for Netanyahu’s reasons. This is his war,” Elgindy said. He added: “ I think every day that this goes on, you get closer to regional expansion of this whole mess.”","Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, said the Arab world was afraid if ""bold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions"" were not made to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, ""the alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East"".

"A court in South Korea has approved an arrest warrant for the country’s suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached over his ill-fated decision to impose martial law early this month, investigators said. Yoon’s decision to declare martial law late on 3 December plunged Asia’s fourth-biggest economy into its worst political crisis for decades and caused concern in Washington. Yoon was forced to lift the order just six hours later after MPs forced their way into parliament to vote it down. The corruption investigation office confirmed that a court in Seoul had approved the warrant, but it was not clear if police would be able to execute it. “The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol … were issued this morning,” the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for Yoon, condemned the move. “The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid,” he said in a statement. Soon after investigators said they had raided the army’s counterintelligence offices as part of the growing martial law probe. “The emergency martial law investigation team of the Corruption Investigation Office is conducting a search and seizure operation at the Counterintelligence Command this afternoon,” investigators said in a statement. Yoon has so far refused to cooperate with the investigation into his martial law order. He has failed to report to investigators for questioning over allegations of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion, and his presidential security service has prevented court-ordered searches of his office and residence. Yoon also faces charges of insurrection – a crime that can carry life imprisonment or the death penalty and one of the few charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. An official from the corruption investigation office said Yoon’s refusal to be questioned had prompted the warrant request. “The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime,” the official said. The warrant is valid until 6 January, he said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.","A court in South Korea has approved an arrest warrant for the country's suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol.

"Media reports said an imminent arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would seek to coordinate with the presidential security service. Technically, anyone obstructing the execution of an arrest warrant could be arrested. But under South Korean law, locations potentially linked to military secrets cannot be seized or searched without the consent of the person in charge, and it is unlikely that Yoon will voluntarily leave his residence if he faces arrest. It is the first time an arrest warrant has been issued for an incumbent president in South Korea, according to local media. Police were deployed early on Tuesday outside Yoon’s residence in central Seoul in an attempt to prevent unrest. Yoon’s supporters and protesters calling for his removal have staked out his residence, with local media showing images of altercations between the two camps overnight. “Unless Yoon voluntarily lets them detain him, there is no way to detain him,” said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. “Should investigators have hand-to-hand fights with the security service?” Choi said that investigators were still likely to visit Yoon’s residence to show they were doing their work diligently and fairly. Park Sung-min, president of the Seoul-based political consulting firm MIN Consulting, said the push for an arrest warrant was probably an attempt to pressure Yoon to cooperate with the investigation. The acting leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power party, Kweon Seong-dong, said on Tuesday that attempting to detain a sitting president was inappropriate, according to Yonhap news agency. Yoon’s presidential powers were suspended after the national assembly voted to impeach him on 14 December over his imposition of martial law. The constitutional court has 180 days from that date to decide whether to confirm the impeachment or reinstate Yoon, whose two-and-a-half years in office have been marred by scandal and policy deadlock. The martial law order triggered weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to facilitate the investigation into his predecessor.","Media reports said an arrest or search of the presidential residence was unlikely, as investigators would try to coordinate with the presidential security service.

The martial law order caused weeks of political and market turmoil. Yoon’s replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached last week for refusing to approve bills to help the investigation into his predecessor."

"In the wake of the April 2019 fire that devastated Notre Dame, the French president Emmanuel Macron promised that the monument would be rebuilt with a “contemporary gesture”. There followed all manner of madcap ideas: a glass spire; a 300ft carbon-fibre flame; a swimming pool on the roof; a covered garden. In the end, Notre Dame was restored to its original former glory and ceremonially reopened this month. Now, however, the planned “contemporary gesture” has been revealed – and has sparked a bitter row. The French artist Claire Tabouret has been chosen to design new stained glass windows depicting Pentecostal scenes, to be installed in the chapels on the south side of the medieval church. Tabouret was among 100 artists who took part in a competition to replace the existing six windows installed by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1844 – even though the windows were not damaged in the 2019 fire. Designs submitted by Tabouret, 43, a figurative artist whose work featured in the Vatican pavilion at the Venice Biennale this year and who now lives in Los Angeles, show scenes of people in prayer in shades of red, turquoise, yellow and pink. She will work with master glassmakers at the Atelier Simon-Marq, a glass workshop founded in Reims in 1640, to recreate the drawings in glass. The plan to replace the 19th-century chapel windows, which feature geometric designs described as having more historic than aesthetic value, has enraged critics. The 1964 Venice Charter, which codifies guidelines for preserving French buildings, states: “Items of sculpture, painting or decoration which form an integral part of a monument may only be removed if this is the sole means of ensuring their preservation,” and that “the valid contributions of all periods to the building of a monument must be respected”. In July, the national committee for heritage and architecture at France’s ministry of culture unanimously opposed the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows, prompting one artist to withdraw his designs from the competition. The Académie des Beaux-Arts has also opposed the replacing of the windows.","In the wake of the April 2019 fire that devastated Notre Dame, the French president Emmanuel Macron promised that the monument would be rebuilt with a ""contemporary gesture"".

"In a statement last year, it wrote: “[The members of the academy] are concerned that the announcement of a competition for the creation of contemporary stained glass windows, which they support in principle, involves replacing the non-figurative windows ... The fire spared these windows. “The Académie des Beaux-Arts hopes that other locations, starting with the North Tower, will be considered for this commission for contemporary stained glass.” However, the plan, expected to cost more than €4m (£3.3m), has the approval of the president, the archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, and the church authorities.

He has launched a petition against the plan that has almost 250,000 signatures. “The president of the republic has decided on his own, without any regard for the heritage law or Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, to replace the stained glass windows in six out of the seven chapels on the south aisle with contemporary creations, after organising a competition,” it reads. “The stained glass windows in Notre Dame designed by Viollet-le-Duc were created as a coherent whole.

"Perhaps a little modesty would be preferable.” The French heritage association Sites &amp; Monuments has threatened legal action if the plan to remove Viollet-le-Duc’s windows goes ahead. Rykner told the Observer: “To remove windows that survived the fire undamaged and replace them with others is just absurd. I am not against contemporary windows per se but there is just no reason to replace these windows. Besides, money donated by people to renovate Notre Dame has already been spent on cleaning them. “It’s absolutely ridiculous. We’ve been told they will put the Viollet-le-Duc windows on display in a museum. They don’t belong in a museum – they belong in Notre Dame. It makes no sense for them to be on display anywhere other than the cathedral. Their only interest is in situ.” He added: “I don’t see why Macron has such a say over what happens to a heritage building. This is just a vanity project. “As for the church authorities approving this – we should remember that the greatest vandalism done to French churches and religious buildings in the 60s and 70s was carried out … by the church. They have no taste.” Stéphane Bern, Macron’s former heritage tsar, voiced his opposition to the plan in an interview with Ouest France newspaper. “I have nothing against Claire Tabouret or contemporary stained glass ... But I am in favour of them when the old ones are destroyed or damaged. You can’t remove stained glass windows that are listed as historic monuments,” Bern said. “Why does the state set itself free from the rules it imposes on others? Just because the president wants it that way?” Simon-Marq will make the six new windows, which will reach 7m high and cover a total surface area of 121 sq metres, and are expected to be installed in 2026.

"I was drawn to Jonathan Freedland’s article (‘How do we live in this terrible world?’ a reader asked me. Here’s the only answer I have, 20 December), as it is a question that’s continually on my mind. There’s much substance in his well-informed piece, though the ending’s quite simple and resonates with my own take: “Perhaps by accepting that it’s the only one we have and that it’s not always so terrible – that sometimes, even quite often, it can be rather beautiful.” One of my responses to this ever-present question is to have gratitude for what I call “magic moments” in nature – like this morning catching sight of the heron, almost invisible, being so amazingly camouflaged among the reeds by a stream; I said “good morning, heron” softly, but didn’t linger because I’ve come to realise that they don’t like being looked at for long. A few years ago, I made a book of Marvellous Mundane Magic for my then 10-year-old granddaughter, to demonstrate to her that magic wasn’t solely the property of wizards. She loved it and now she’s noting her own and giving them to me to make a new book. Even a short early-morning walk offers magic if your eyes and ears are open, even if it’s just hearing a winter robin or seeing herb robert still flowering by a path. Margaret Turner Exeter • Jonathan Freedland gave us “a few reasons to be hopeful” about living in this terrible world. Thank you – they are good reasons: drawing strength from those who “dare to swim against even the bleakest tides”, celebrating what is good, and remembering that this is the only world we have, and that it is often beautiful. These reasons all involve looking outwards, observing. A complementary way of being hopeful – and happy – is looking inwards and acting on our values. Alone, or with the help of activist citizen groups.

"Our thanks to them for doing more than observing. And happy new year to all. Patrick and Alison Duncan Norton, North Yorkshire • The most important component of staying optimistic in these troubled times is positive action. When we look at the world in despair, we should ask ourselves: “What can I do to improve it?” The only way the world gets better is through lots of people showing more love, empathy and care. Especially at Christmas, there are ample opportunities to make a difference to someone’s life. A donation to a charity, a kind word to a stranger, a Christmas card sent to a neighbour. Picking up rubbish, volunteering, donating to a food bank. It might not be much as a single deed, but imagine 9 billion little actions. Wow! Here’s to a better future for all. Hanna Pennig Forglen, Aberdeenshire • I cannot hope – but I can, and do, take it one day at a time. Being in the now opens me up to the small joys that everyday life offers. A toddler on the bus who smiles at me; a dog waiting patiently outside a supermarket; a sunny day. I have no agency to change the big things, but I am in control of how I respond to them. Lyn Dade Twickenham, London • Jonathan Freedland is helpful and encouraging in his reply to the question: “How do we live in this terrible world?” My own way of struggling with terrible news is to remind myself that wherever there is suffering, even of great magnitude, there are wonderful people struggling to alleviate it. The work they do and the sacrifices they make lift up our hearts and spirits. The annual Guardian and Observer charity appeal helps and encourages us to support such people not only at Christmas, but throughout the year.

"As families in Taiwan prepare to gather for lunar new year celebrations in January, a game that will be released that month promises to offer some war-themed fun over the festive period. The board game 2045, developed by the Taiwanese company Mizo Games, invites players to participate in an imaginary Chinese invasion 20 years in the future. Players are given roles that include Taiwanese army officers, Chinese sleeper agents and volunteer citizen fighters. “We can’t predict the future, but if a conflict is unavoidable I hope this game gives people a chance to experience war on the tabletop before it reaches us,” KJ Chang, the founder of Mizo Games, told the Wall Street Journal. The game is being released at a time when China has increased its military pressure around the self-governing island. Taiwan has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China but Beijing regards it as part of its territory and has promised to “unify” it with China, using force if necessary. Observers do not know when, if ever, China will launch a military operation against Taiwan. But some analysts have pointed to the years around 2050 as a possible risk period. Xi Jinping, China’s leader and military commander-in-chief, has pledged to build a “world-class army” by the middle of the century, and 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic of China, is the date by which Beijing wants to achieve “national rejuvenation”. Mizo Games launched a crowdfunding campaign for their new product in August. Within months, it had raised NTD$4.1m (£99,468), surpassing its original target by more than 4,000%. 2045 is the latest in a series of entertainment products in Taiwan that focus on the threat of an attempted Chinese annexation. This year also saw the release of Zero Day, a Taiwanese government-funded television series that depicts a Chinese invasion. It also received support from Robert Tsao, a Taiwanese tech billionaire and supporter of Taiwan’s civil defence efforts. As well as receiving the first copies of the game, VIP backers of the crowdfunding campaign will receive extra Taiwan-themed products.","As families in Taiwan celebrate the lunar new year in January, a game that will be released that month promises to have some war-themed fun over the festive period.

"The tech entrepreneur and close adviser to Donald Trump Elon Musk has taken a stunning new public step in his support for the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), publishing a supportive guest opinion piece for the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper that has prompted the commentary editor to resign in protest. The commentary piece in German was launched online on Saturday before being published on Sunday in the flagship paper of the Axel Springer media group, which also owns the US politics news site Politico. Musk uses populist and personal language to try to deny AfD’s extremist bent, and the essay expands on his post on his social media platform, X, on which he last week claimed that “only the AfD can save Germany”. Translated, Musk’s piece said: “The portrayal of the AfD as rightwing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party’s leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!” Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has classified the AfD at the national level as a suspected extremism case since 2021. Shortly after the piece was published online, the editor of the opinion section, Eva Marie Kogel, used the US tech mogul’s own platform to post on X that she had submitted her resignation. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion department at Welt and Wams. Today a text by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. Yesterday I submitted my resignation after printing,” she posted. She included a link to the Musk commentary article. The AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance and, like incoming president Donald Trump in relation to the US, is calling for mass deportations from Germany. Earlier in December, Musk not only posted in favor of AfD but the party’s hard line on immigration appeared to resonate with the incoming US vice-president, JD Vance, MSNBC reported.

"This includes dealing with polarising positions and classifying them journalistically,” the newspaper’s editor-in-chief designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, and Ulf Poschardt, who takes over as publisher on 1 January, told Reuters. They said discussion about Musk’s piece, which had about 340 comments several hours after it was published, was “very revealing”. Underneath Musk’s commentary, the newspaper published a response by Burgard. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally false,” he wrote, referencing the AfD’s desire to leave the European Union and seek rapprochement with Russia as well as appease China. Musk and Weidel both later posted a link to the article on X. The AfD backing from Musk, who also defended his right to weigh in on German politics due to his “significant investments”, comes as Germans are set to vote on 23 February after a coalition government led by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed late this fall. The AfD is running second in opinion polls and might be able to thwart either a centre-right or centre-left majority, but Germany’s mainstream, more centrist parties have pledged to shun any support from the AfD at the national level.","The new leaders of the newspaper spoke to Reuters.

"Dominique Pelicot will not appeal against his conviction for drugging and raping his wife and inviting strangers to rape her, his lawyer has said. Béatrice Zavarro said the former electrician, 72, who was jailed for the maximum 20 years this month, wished to spare his now ex-wife, Gisèle Pelicot, a new ordeal but admitted there was also the risk a new trial in front of a public jury could mean a longer prison sentence. Pelicot and the 50 others who were all found guilty of rape or sexual assault after a three-and-a-half-month trial have until midnight on Monday to lodge an appeal. A statement from public prosecutor confirmed that 17 people had so far appealed against their convictions, adding that a new trial would be held in Nîmes towards the end of next year. Gisèle Pelicot, 72, a retired logistics manager, believes she may have been raped more than 200 times by her husband and other men between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after filming up the skirts of female shoppers in a supermarket near the couple’s home in the Provençal town of Mazan. Detectives subsequently found tens of thousands of videos of the abuse on his phone and a hard drive. On Monday, Zavarro said Dominique Pelicot had decided not to appeal against his conviction because to do so would “force Gisèle into a new ordeal and new confrontations, which [he] rejects”. Appealing against the guilty judgment, when Pelicot admitted the charges, would involve “running an unnecessary risk”, she added, as the accusations could be made more serious in the appeal court, where the case would be held in front of a public jury, potentially leading to a longer prison term. “It is time to put an end to this judicially,” Zavarro said on Monday. The marathon rape trial in Avignon was heard by a panel of five professional magistrates. The appeal court, which sits in the southern city of Nîmes, will require a new full trial within the next year. Gisèle Pelicot is not required to attend the appeal hearing but her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, indicated she was ready to do so.","Dominique Pelicot will not appeal his conviction for drugging and raping his wife and inviting strangers to rape her, his lawyer said.

"“She has told us she will be there. Maybe not every day but she says she will go,” he said. She became an international feminist figurehead after insisting the trial be held in open court and the videos of her abuse shown in order that “shame changes sides”.

"Work has begun to conserve and digitise one of the oldest paper documents still in existence on the island of Ireland. The ecclesiastical register, which dates back to the medieval period, is about 650 years old. It belonged to the former archbishop of Armagh Milo Sweteman. Its delicate pages are being repaired by experts at the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland (Proni) as part of an initiative to rejuvenate and preserve some of the island of Ireland’s most important historical texts. Ecclesiastical registers contain copies or drafts of documents created by the archbishops’ administration work, including legal papers, official letters, correspondence, receipts and wills. The register belonging to Sweteman dates to his time in the senior clerical role from 1361 to 1380. Conservation work on the register of archbishop John Swayne, dated from 1418 to 1438, has already been completed and a digitised copy, along with a translated summary, are now available online. The conservation work on the Swayne books involved carefully detaching bindings dating from the 17th century, gently washing all the paper folios and then consolidating each piece of paper with a weak gelatine solution. Tears and losses in the paper were infilled with Japanese kozo paper before the books were rebound using 17th-century binding material. The work now under way on the Sweteman register involves the need to repair damage that resulted from previous conservation efforts dating back to the start of the 20th century when tracing paper was placed on the pages in an attempt to preserve them. The tracing paper was acidic and actually accelerated the corrosion of the ink and paper. It is now being removed using a specialist gel before being subjected to a low-pressure washing process. The same kozo paper and wheat starch paste repairs used for Swayne’s register are then being undertaken. Similar work is being carried out on a third register, dated between 1400 and 1418, that belonged to former archbishop Nicholas Fleming. Sarah Graham, head of conservation at Proni, explained that paper was extremely rare on the island of Ireland when the registers were compiled.","Work is being done to conserve and digitise one of the oldest paper documents still in existence on the island of Ireland.

"It was a period that just predated the invention of the printing press when parchment from animal skins was still the preferred writing material. “Paper that pre-dates 1450 is particularly rare, it didn’t occur in Ireland for a couple of centuries after the register of Milo Sweteman or the register of John Swayne were completed,” said Graham. “We’ve done some research into the watermarks and know that the paper came from Italy and from Spain.” Graham said it was likely the archbishops imported the paper to Ireland during their travels around Europe.

"South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine has died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces. Seoul’s spy agency earlier on Friday confirmed Ukrainian reports that an injured North Korean soldier had been captured by Ukrainian forces, in what was likely to have been the first capture of its kind since Pyongyang sent combat forces to bolster Russian forces in the war. The South Korean national intelligence service said in a statement: “Through real-time information sharing with an allied country’s intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured.” The agency later said the captured soldier had died from his injuries. A photo of the soldier, who looked gaunt and appeared to have been injured, circulated on the Telegram messaging app, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. In his nightly video address on Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said North Korean troops fighting in Russia’s Kursk region are suffering heavy losses and being left unprotected by Moscow’s forces. Ukraine’s president said Russian troops were doing everything to ensure that North Korean soldiers were not taken prisoner by Kyiv. He said some North Korean soldiers had been captured by Ukrainian forces, but were hurt so badly they could not be saved. Earlier the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reported that special forces had captured the soldier in the Kursk region, where Ukraine has seized and held some territory. The outlet did not say when the capture took place, and there has been no confirmation from officials in Ukraine or North Korea, where the state media have not referred to the deployment of the country’s troops. Militarnyi said that if it was confirmed, the soldier would be the first North Korean combatant to have been taken by Ukrainian forces. As many as 11,000 soldiers from North Korea have been deployed to help Russia, months after Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin signed a mutual defence pact that committed each country to come to the other’s aid if attacked. While the North could gain valuable battlefield experience, its poorly trained soldiers, fighting in unfamiliar territory, have quickly been exposed to the dangers of combat.","South Korea’s intelligence agency has reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine has died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces.

"Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known as the GUR, said on Thursday that North Korean troops were suffering heavy losses in the fighting in Kursk and facing logistical difficulties as a result of Ukrainian attacks. The GUR said Ukrainian strikes near Novoivanovka had inflicted heavy casualties on North Korean units and that North Korean troops also faced supply issues, including shortages of drinking water. This week Zelenskyy claimed that more than 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region. It was the first significant estimate by Ukraine of North Korean casualties. On Friday a White House spokesperson said 1,000 North Korean troops had been killed or wounded in Kursk in the past week alone. “It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defences,” John Kirby said. He described the North Korean troops’ offensive as “massed, dismounted assaults” and said Joe Biden was likely to approve another security assistance package for Ukraine in coming days. The deployment of North Korean soldiers marked a dramatic escalation in the war, which began almost three years ago, as the Kremlin turned to its ally to boost its forces. It was also seen as an attempt by Putin to broaden the conflict through the direct involvement in fighting of a third country. Slovakia, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that it would host peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, despite Ukraine’s accusation that it is playing into the hands of Putin. On Thursday the Russian president said it was “acceptable” for the country to become a “platform” for dialogue over the conflict, which the US president-elect, Donald Trump, has said he could end after he takes office in January. That prospect has raised concerns in Kyiv that a settlement could be imposed on terms favourable to Moscow, as Ukraine struggles on the battlefield.","Ukraine's military intelligence agency is GUR.

"At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina, his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul, were taking in the picture-perfect waters of Patong bay as they ate breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel on Boxing Day morning in 2004. “We were admiring the view and all of a sudden the water disappeared,” says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. “The locals thought, ‘This is fantastic.’ They were running around picking the fish up.” Now Giardina knows it’s a sign to flee to higher ground. About 550km to the south-west, a magnitude 9.15 earthquake had struck 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering what would become the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians among more than 230,000 people whose lives were lost across 14 countries – in some impact zones, the waves reached up to 3o metres above sea level. Twenty years on, Giardina’s memories of the disaster are as vivid as they were in its immediate aftermath. “It really feels like it was only yesterday,” he says of that initially deceptive morning. Within about half an hour the sea had returned to its normal level and settled, then it began to swirl, gently stirring up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A small amount of water – no more than 20cm – washed on to the road bordering the restaurant. “It didn’t look dangerous – we said, ‘We’re going to get wet,’” Giardina remembers. But when a car was washed towards the hotel, he began to run, leading Paul by the hand and then attempting to protect his son by holding him against a pillar inside the hotel. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind, throwing them over an internal wall and ripping Giardina’s clothes from his body.","At first, there was nothing to fear.

It was 9. 15 earthquakes hit 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries. In some areas, the waves reached up to 30 metres high. Twenty years later, Giardina’s memories of the disaster are as vivid as they were in its immediate aftermath. ""It really feels like it was only yesterday,"" he says of that first deceptive morning. The sea returned to normal in about half an hour. It settled. Then it started to swirl. It gently stirred up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A little water - no more than 20cm - was washed on to the road near the restaurant. ""It didn't look dangerous - we said, 'We're going to get wet,'"" Giardina remembers. A car was washed to the hotel. He ran. He led Paul by the hand. He held his son against a pillar inside the hotel to protect him. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind, throwing them over an internal wall and ripping Giardina’s clothes from his body.","At first, there seemed nothing to be afraid of. Joe Giardina was with his wife, Evanna, and their 16-year-old son, Paul. They were eating breakfast in their Phuket beachfront hotel. It was Boxing Day in 2004. They were taking in the beautiful waters of Patong bay. ""We were admiring the view and suddenly the water disappeared,"" says Giardina, 67, speaking from his home in Rosanna, Victoria. The water level had dropped so quickly that fish were floundering on the exposed seabed. But rather than sensing any threat, curious onlookers made their way to the beach. Now Giardina knows it’s a sign to flee to higher ground. About 550km to the south-west, there was an earthquake. It was 9. 15 earthquakes hit 30km below the Andaman Sea, triggering the most devastating tsunami in history. Paul was one of 26 Australians who died. More than 230,000 people died in 14 countries.

The sea returned to normal in about half an hour. It settled. Then it started to swirl. It gently stirred up the sand below. Almost simultaneously, the nearby pier started to float away. A small amount of water – no more than 20cm – washed on to the road bordering the restaurant. A car was washed to the hotel. He ran and led Paul by the hand. He then held his son against a pillar in the hotel. He was trying to protect him. Seconds later, a waist-high wall of water hit them from behind. It threw them over an internal wall. The water broke Giardina's clothes from his body."
"Cars and tables slammed into the building as everything in the path of the 800km/h wave was lifted and flung high. Something hit Giardina on the back of the head and he went under, losing hold of Paul. Giardina found himself pushed horizontally against the outer corner of the hotel when a large object – a car, a fridge, he’ll never know – pinned his left arm to the wall. “I’m trying with my right hand to get out, get around the corner, to push away whatever was holding me. And I just couldn’t get there. I was underwater and I held my breath for as long as I could. The last thing I recall is just opening my mouth and that was it. The lights went off.” Today, he still finds consolation in the thought that Paul, whose body was found in a makeshift morgue by Joe’s brothers-in-law three days later, might have experienced something similar. “I can only hope – and it’s terrible – but I can only hope that Paul went through the same experience,” he says. “There was no suffering.” The Giardinas had weighed up whether to visit Thailand or Bali for Paul’s first overseas trip. Paul had Down’s syndrome and, while physically high-functioning, was unable to care for himself. Phuket seemed a safer option two years after Bali’s terrorist attacks and the family – Paul’s sister, two years his senior, stayed in Australia – chose to celebrate Christmas at Patong’s Seaview hotel, where Paul played ball in the swimming pool and was photographed smiling with Santa. Joe and Evanna called their affectionate son the “love machine”. “Twice in his short life, he had open heart surgery. The second time, he’d had a valve replaced in his heart, and when he’s woken up from the surgery, what was his first comment? It wasn’t tears and crying and screaming, it was ‘What happened?’ There wouldn’t be too many of us behaving that way,” Joe Giardina says, laughing. Giardina was found inside the hotel, lying prone and headfirst down a flight of steps on the third storey.","Cars and tables slammed into the building as everything in the path of the 800km/h wave was lifted and flung high.

"His position saved his life: water drained out of his body. Initially deemed unlikely to survive, he was eventually taken to Bangkok hospital in Phuket, where the pain from his extensive injuries was numbed by the fear that he had lost Paul and Evanna. His wife was found unhurt and later reunited with him – she had ridden the wave to the hotel, grabbed hold of a balcony and miraculously avoided being sucked back out to sea. When Giardina was medevaced to Melbourne, the doctors’ first job was to flush the sand out of his lungs. “The one thing that it has taught me is how quickly it can all come to an end. You appreciate every day when you go through something like that,” he says, describing the speed at which the morning went from one of tropical calm to earth-shattering calamity. He and Evanna are grateful to have found Paul’s body among Thailand’s 5,400 victims, “because if we hadn’t, I know that there would be a sense of ‘He could be out there still’. And where do you start? We would have been walking the streets looking for him. And that would have been …” He pauses. “How do you cope with that?” It’s not accidental that when visitors to the Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial take in the wave-shaped sculpture on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, they are also facing the water. Giardina instigated the memorial and requested that its aspect include water. Its unveiling in December 2015 was the first time Joe and Evanna had met all 25 of the other Australian victims’ families, after a 10-year process involving three governments. It’s given them a place where they can remember Paul, and this 26 December they plan to be there again, with their son in spirit. But part of Paul will always remain in Phuket. Joe and Evanna returned to Patong in October 2005 and again on the first anniversary of the disaster, and Joe has visited Thailand many times since, partly so that the tsunami does not dictate how he lives. “It’s part of the healing.

"The United Nations chief has denounced the “escalation” in hostilities between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Israel, calling IDF strikes on targets including at the airport in Sana’a “especially alarming” after it came under attack while the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. Israel struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, including the international airport in the capital, Sana’a. Houthi media said at least six people were killed.

A crew member on the plane was injured, he said, and at least two people were reported killed at the airport. “The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge – just a few meters from where we were – and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave. My UN and @WHO colleagues and I are safe.

"We will persist in this until we complete the task.” Netanyahu said in an interview with Channel 14 that Israel was only at the beginning of its campaign against the Houthis. “We are just getting started with them,” he said. Houthis have repeatedly fired drones and missiles towards Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli military said that in addition to striking the airport, it also hit military infrastructure at the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib on Yemen’s west coast. It also attacked the country’s Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said that three people were killed in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, while 40 others were wounded in the attacks. Later on Thursday, the Houthis said they were ready to respond quickly to the attack and meet “escalation with escalation”, Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported. The Houthi transport minister told Saba that both the airport and Hodeidah port would resume normal operations from Friday. More than a year of Houthi attacks has disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys that have in turn stoked fears over global inflation. The UN security council is due to meet on Monday over the Houthi attacks on Israel, Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel’s military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people.

Al Masirah TV reported this on Thursday. The Houthis said they were ready to respond quickly. They said they would meet escalation with escalation. The Houthi transport minister told Saba that both the airport and Hodeidah port will resume normal operations on Friday. More than a year of Houthi attacks has disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys, which have in turn raised fears about global inflation. The UN security council will meet on Monday. The meeting is about Houthi attacks on Israel. Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon said this on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel’s military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people."
"Paul Volcker, who has died aged 92, was the most eminent financial statesman of his generation, the sworn enemy of the abuse of finance in any of its manifestations. That could be indulging inflation as the financial outcome of governments and society living beyond their means, or investment banks deluding themselves they had uncovered the alchemy of risk-free lending through the issuance of ever more complex financial derivatives. His twin mantras were that finance should be the servant not the master of economy and society. And that good government is an indispensable component of a good society, in particular keeping the temptations of clever-clever finance at bay. Sound money and good government went hand in hand. He practised what he preached, seizing the opportunity to embody his beliefs when the moment arrived. Standing over 6ft 7in, and a lover of over-sized cigars and fly-fishing, he represented the best of New England liberalism – genial, good humoured and steely. From August 1979 to August 1987 he was chairman of the US Federal Reserve, the US’s central bank, appointed by Democrat President Jimmy Carter and and reappointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. In the early part of that period he crushed inflation out of the US economy. Just 18 months after he was appointed he had the courage to raise interest rates to 20% – a rate never seen before – prompting mass protests as the US economy plunged into recession. But he held firm and succeeded, inflation peaking at 14.8% before falling back to 3% by 1983. The foundations had been laid for sustained economic recovery and in the process warranting the principle that central bank independence is a crucial precondition for robust monetary policy. It was one of the defining moments in US monetary policy history, winning him plaudits not only for his resilience in the face of near universal criticism but also from the small but fast growing influential band of free market, “monetarist” economists who believed that control of the money supply using high interest rates was the sole means to curb inflation – not any kind of government interference into the market processes for setting wages and prices. Volcker temporarily was their hero.

"Volcker never bought the proposition that the market was magical or that there could be a systematic relationship between the growth of the money supply and inflation. Rather he was intuitively suspicious of the short term and predatory instincts of most financial market participants, which lead to volatile and unpredictable market movements, and intuitively suspicious of the mania for dismantling the New Deal rules and regulations that restrained their worst types of behaviours that “free market“ economists said were inhibiting the efficiency of the US financial system. His willingness to be austere in raising interest rates so high was because he knew dear money worked reliably in squeezing inflation – not because he was an advocate of a hyper-free-market economy. He would be equally austere in resisting the siren calls to deregulate finance in the name of freeing up the market. It would come to no good. Nor did it. Volcker was a critic of successive rounds of financial deregulation after he left office, saying that the only useful financial innovation he had encountered was the invention of the ATM – cash dispensing machines. Even before the 2008-09 financial crisis he was warning that the invention of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps were inherently unstable, in effect transferring risk to the Federal Reserve, which would be compelled to underwrite the financial system if the markets ever lost confidence in them. So it proved as the financial crisis broke for precisely the reasons about which he had warned – unlike his successor Alan Greenspan, who had enthusiastically and uncritically embraced financial deregulation. President Obama appointed him head of the president’s economic advisory board in 2009 in the midst of the crisis. There he argued that the emergence of banks that were too big to fail, so forcing central bank rescues, was morally and economically insupportable and they should be broken up. If that was politically impossible then at least commercial banks who took deposits from the ordinary public should be banned from trading in high-risk financial derivatives on their own account – the so-called Volcker rule. Obama adopted the proposal and it became section 619 of the 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act; banks cannot own, invest in or sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds or other trading operations for their own use.","Volcker never thought the market was magical or there could be a systematic relationship between the growth of the money supply and inflation.

"Volcker had once again made an indelible mark on the US financial system, and influenced British thinking in the legal obligation to ringfence commercial and investment bank operations. Born in Cape May, on the southern tip of New Jersey, Paul Jr was the son of Paul Volcker, a civil engineer, and his wife, Alma (nee Klippel); his grandparents were all German immigrants. He grew up in the conventional world of 1930s and 40s America – going to high school, attending the local Lutheran church, but already showing an interest in public affairs and a precocious intelligence . He gained a degree in history, economics and political science at Princeton University (1949), and went on to do a master’s in political economy and government at Harvard, and to study at the London school of Economics. In 1952 he joined the New York Federal Reserve as an economist. A career alternating between Wall Street and the US Treasury in ever more responsible jobs then followed before fatefully he caught the eye of President Carter in 1979. He was a convinced believer in international collaboration, helping to fashion the Plaza accords in 1986 when Germany and Japan agreed to allow their currencies to appreciate, so limiting their trade imbalances with the US. This vital adjustment, he knew, would not come from market forces spontaneously but from intergovernmental collaboration. He was a founder of the Trilateral Commission, to foster relations between Japan, western Europe and north America, and regular attender at the Bilderberg meetings of leaders and experts from Europe and north America, believing that the key international players had to understand each other better. Towards the end of his life this believer in the power, capacity and importance of good government became increasingly concerned about the collapse of trust in government, founding the Volcker Alliance to advance the understanding of – and education for – careers in public service.

"High street sales slumped in November in the weakest period for consumer spending for more than a year, as shoppers reined in their spending in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales across Britain fell by 0.6% when compared with the previous month, with only household goods stores reporting growth. In a sign of the stress facing retailers, the quantity of goods bought dropped by 0.4% in the three months to November compared with the previous three months, the first decline since April 2018. Annual growth in sales also slowed to 1%, mainly because of a slump in spending in non-food stores. The latest figures from the high street and online suggest heavy discounting around Black Friday failed to tempt consumers to part with their cash in one of the worst periods for retailers in recent decades. Analysts said unsettled weather, political and economic uncertainty over Brexit and the snap election, and consumers leaving their shopping to the last minute in hope of bigger discounts, all had an impact last month. High street retailers are also struggling with rising wage bills and the cost of business rates, as well as tough competition as consumers switch to online shopping. Recognising the difficulties on the high street, the government said it was committed to a “fundamental review” of business rates and announced new measures to help independent retailers in the Queen’s speech on Thursday. The measures include a 50% discount on business rates for small to medium-sized high street properties including shops, pubs and restaurants with a rateable value of less than £51,000, up from a 33% discount at present. The discount is also being extended to cinemas and music venues. The plans are unlikely to do much to help troubled major retailers such as House of Fraser or Debenhams as retail chains are not eligible for the discount and neither are large department stores. November was the fourth month in a row without growth in retail spending – the longest stretch since the mid-90s. The ONS said Black Friday was not included in the figures, as the US-inspired day of shopping discounts fell late in the month, on 29 November. It said its seasonally adjusted estimates accounted for this shift in timing. However, analysts said the timing of Black Friday could have had an impact and probably distorted November’s spending figures. The ONS said Black Friday spending patterns would probably influence its December release, with only early promotions captured in the November estimates.","High street sales fell in November, the worst period for consumer spending for more than a year, as shoppers cut their spending before Christmas.

"No one has dug into the vaults of the Bank of England and pilfered a gold bar, but security breaches for a central bank in the 21st-century age of information do not come much worse than this. Hedge funds have managed to gain access to an audio feed of the governor’s press conferences, thereby securing for themselves an advantage of a few seconds over viewers of the slightly delayed TV broadcast. In modern frantic markets, seconds can matter. The misuse of the audio feed by an unnamed third-party supplier is “wholly unacceptable”, said the Bank after the report by the Times. The governor, Mark Carney, will be squirming with embarrassment. He arrived in 2013 on a mission to modernise the Bank’s operations and information security was top of the list. Now Threadneedle Street stands accused of gross naivety. The audio feed was designed as a back-up in case the TV system failed, but the potential for mischief should have been obvious. The Bank left a back door, if not wide open, then significantly ajar. The call for somebody’s resignation will be loud. No hedge fund or trader, it should be said, had advance knowledge of the Bank’s actual policy decisions, which are the main event on these stage-managed occasions. Interest rate decisions, for example, are announced to the world on the stroke of midday, and the full set of accompanying documents is published simultaneously. Journalists are allowed to read the contents in advance only if they are locked in the bowels of the Bank until midday in a secure room with no wifi or mobile phone signal. The security breach concerns only the press conferences, which start at 12.30pm. A consolation for the Bank, one could argue, is that Carney’s press conferences tend to be spectacularly dull. He’s in the business of explaining reports that are in the public domain by the time he speaks and he tends not to stray far from his mental script. For ordinary mortals, a five-second informational advantage might be useless. Even five minutes to wade through Carney’s sub-clauses might not yield nuggets to indicate if the pound should be moving up, down or sideways.","No one has stolen gold from the Bank of England's vaults.

"The trouble is, there is a breed of hedge funds that does not operate like ordinary mortals do. They’re pursuing fast action and even the possibility of morsels of information count in their world. Some even run artificial intelligence computer programmes to alight on specific words or phrases and then trade instantly, and perhaps only for a brief second, on what they learn. This type of hedge fund may also be interested in what Carney doesn’t say, as much as what he does, in response to a question. Such strategies seek only marginal gains, and success is clearly not guaranteed, but a central bank simply cannot give anybody any theoretical opportunity to get ahead of the market. The fallout from this affair will be fascinating. The Financial Conduct Authority will have to decide if the third-party supplier (which surely won’t remain unidentified for long) has merely breached its contract with the Bank or has committed market abuse, which is a serious regulatory matter. The market abuse question also applies to the hedge funds, though the FCA will face an obvious difficulty in proving that a trade was placed because of access to the audio feed rather than something unrelated.

"Saturday was not so super for retailers last weekend, as numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres fell by nearly 8% compared with the previous year. With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and often hang on for last-minute bargains. More than a third (36%) of Brits have left gift-buying until the last few days before Christmas, according to Argos. It said 10% more men than women leave gift-buying until very late, with the most popular gift bought in its stores on Christmas Eve last year being an electric toothbrush. John Lewis expected novelty socks and gadgets such as airpods and smart speakers to be its most popular last-minute items. Monday was expected to be the busiest day for food retailers with Waitrose expecting to sell 214,000kg of sprouts in the final days before Christmas and 250% more quails eggs than usual. The lower turnout recorded by shopper monitoring firm Springboard on Saturday –traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year – came despite a flurry of discounts from retailers in an effort to tempt bargain hunters after a difficult trading year. Industry experts said the plethora of promotions on offer since November, and particularly over the Black Friday discount period at the end of November, meant many had spent their money early or were underwhelmed by further price cuts. Late last week Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to up to 60%, from 40% and 50% respectively earlier in the week, while Jigsaw, Peacocks and House of Fraser increased their price cuts to 50%, matching Debenhams, Hobbs and Oasis, which had deepened their discounts. Marks &amp; Spencer also added knitwear to its price-cutting pile, offering 40% off its key seasonal category, as well as a half-price on beauty gifts offer. The difficult trading is expected to bring further distress for retailers in early 2020 after numerous administrations and store closures this year. The number of retailers in financial distress in the final quarter of the year has risen 1.4% on the same period last year to 27,000, according to data from the corporate recovery firm Begbies Traynor. Fashion chains are among the worst affected, with the number in distress increasing by 21% in the past three years to 3,355.","Saturday was not so good for retailers last weekend, with numbers visiting high streets and shopping centres falling by almost 8% compared to the previous year.

"The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal. After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats. The sources said at least 20 of the Bank’s staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation’s payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources. The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank’s real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth £651bn. According to the former employees, the Bank’s chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year. Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney’s departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale. Much of the disquiet stemmed from a move to dismantle the Bank’s “security and privacy” directorate, the people said. The team, part of the central services division, previously had oversight over cyber, personnel and physical security matters, as well as privacy. Staff and responsibilities were instead spread across other parts of the organisation.","The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost several senior staff in charge of protecting some of Britain’s most important financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal.

"It is understood that many of the people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directorates, in a move designed to make the organisation safer. The Bank has about 70 cybersecurity professionals. A Bank of England spokeswoman said: “The Bank operates the highest standard of information security and is confident in our ability to recognise cyber threats and defend our systems appropriately. Earlier this year, the Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model and, as part of that, reinforced the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.” The Bank admitted late on Wednesday night that it had suffered a security breach, with a provider of a backup audio feed of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences selling early access to unnamed investors without its knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit. It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating the issue, and it is understood that Bailey will recuse himself from all discussions of the matter to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest. The Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, is the most senior manager responsible for physical and information security, and faced calls to resign from a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, Danny Blanchflower, following the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor, and has an equal status to the Bank’s deputy governors. Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services division, which was managed by Place. They said the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, warned in December 2018 that the Bank needed to deliver better value for money. Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him. A spokeswoman for the Bank said Rogers resigned on 23 February and that Place was not aware he was going to quit when she gave evidence on 21 January.","Many people now sit under the Bank’s technology, security and risk directories, in a move designed to make the bank safer.

She said the Bank is confident in its ability to detect cyber threats. It is also confident in its ability to defend its systems properly. The Bank completed a review of its central services target operating model earlier this year and, in doing so, strengthened the arrangements for first- and second-line information security. This change was fully supported by the Bank’s audit and risk committee.” The Bank said it had a security breach late Wednesday night. A backup audio feed provider had sold early access. This feed was of the governor’s market-sensitive press conferences. The provider sold access to unnamed investors without the Bank's knowledge. Those investors could have used the few seconds’ advantage to profit. It was alerted to the breach by the Times newspaper, conducted a rapid internal investigation and passed the matter to the FCA. The City watchdog has confirmed it is investigating. Bailey will not talk to everyone. This is to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest. Joanna Place is the Bank's chief operating officer. She is the most senior manager in physical and information security. A former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee called for her to quit. Danny Blanchflower made these calls after the breach. Place, who was appointed in July 2017, reports directly to the governor and has the same status as the Bank’s deputy governors. Multiple sources said the Bank was under pressure to cut the budget of the central services division, which was managed by Place. The National Audit Office warned the Bank. It said the Bank must deliver better value for money. Place told the Commons’ public accounts committee in January that the Bank did not “have any gaps in cybersecurity”. However, her chief information security officer, Cameron “Buck” Rogers, resigned little over a month later. Multiple other security experts followed him."
"At the hearing, Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, expressed surprise at Place’s answer, given the difficulties other public-sector organisations had with recruiting and retaining cyber security staff, and asked again if there were any vacancies. Place responded: “Offhand, I do not know whether we have any vacancies, but we do not have a problem with recruiting and we do not have a problem with retention in cyber, either.” There was widespread unease within the Bank following her testimony, multiple sources said, and in the months after her appearance the cybersecurity function suffered the outflow of staff. The public sector struggles to retain staff in cybersecurity roles because of intense competition from the higher-paying private sector. However, the reputation of the Bank and its important role in protecting financial stability are attractive for potential candidates, and the sources said they believed it was in the public interest to shed light on the problems it was facing. A Bank of England spokesperson said: “The incident relating to the misuse of a backup audio feed from the Bank’s press conferences by a third-party supplier, which the Bank has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority for further investigation, was not a cyber security issue.”","Meg Hillier is Labour chair of the committee.

"UK high streets have shed more than 140,000 jobs this year as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most challenging years in a generation. More than 2,750 jobs were lost every week, according to a detailed analysis by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) published today. It predicts the picture will worsen in 2020, unless the government intervenes, with high business rates one of the factors blamed for accelerating chain store closures. Prof Joshua Bamfield, the CRR’s director, said retail was in crisis owing to high costs, low levels of profitability and sales moving online. “These problems are felt by most businesses operating from physical stores in high streets or shopping malls,” Bamfield said. “The low growth in consumer spending since 2015 has meant that the growth in online sales has come at the expense of the high street.” The CRR said 38,100 of the jobs lost this year were down to retail chains going bust with Karen Millen and Coast among 2019’s high profile casualties. Another 26,500 roles were shed through company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a controversial insolvency procedure that has been used by the likes of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group and Debenhams to shed loss-making stores. Another 78,600 jobs were axed through cost-cutting programmes by large retailers or small shops simply shutting for good. Marks &amp; Spencer is among the big names closing stores while House of Fraser, which is part of Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, has also been shutting outlets. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, according to CRR’s calculations, up by more than a fifth on 2018’s 117,400. The CRR also calculated that 16,073 shops closed around the UK in 2019, or around 61 every working day. That was an increase on the 14,583 shops which closed in 2018. A separate study looking at how the UK labour market had changed over the past decade said the rise of online shopping had eliminated 289,000 “traditional” high street roles. Eight out of 10 of these entry-level retail jobs – positions like sales assistant and checkout operator – were held by women, according to the RSA Future Work Centre.","UK high streets have lost more than 140,000 jobs this year as store closures and retail failures made 2019 one of the most difficult years in a generation.

"The thinktank is part of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the charity run by Matthew Taylor who authored a gig economy review for Theresa May when she was prime minister. Alan Lockey, who heads the thinktank, said: “The carnage on the high street has hollowed out many jobs traditionally held by women, but areas of growth related to e-commerce, such as van driving, are going more to men. This is having a profound effect on individuals, families and society.” Today one in every five pounds spent at the shops is online – more than double the level at the start of the decade. The resulting shift in labour markets are stark. There are now 166,000 fewer check-out staff, shelf fillers and sales assistants than at the start of the 2010s, according to RSA’s analysis of official employment data, while the pool of bank and post office clerks has shrunk by 65,000 as branches closed. By comparison there are 102,000 more van drivers and 161,000 more administration roles. Lockey said the decline of the high street was the most dramatic factor affecting the UK’s jobs landscape, even though austerity, which had eliminated 109,000 public sector administrators, also loomed large. Despite the reckoning taking place the retail sector remains the UK’s biggest private sector employer with a workforce of around 3 million. Its decline contrasts with a wider picture showing record levels of employment as former shop workers find alternative work in restaurants, hotels and as care workers. The RSA study showed a near 78,000 rise in the number of care workers. “The employment figures show that over the last decade the economy has been good at creating jobs but low skilled workers in the retail sector have been pushed from pillar to post. The alternative jobs they are getting are often low paid and do not provide good security, leading to working poverty,” Lockey added. The important Christmas trading period appears to have brought little respite for struggling retail chains. Trading during November and December was marred by heavy discounting as stores sought to tempt out shoppers put off by the uncertainty around Brexit and the 12 December general election. The post-Christmas sales got off to a disappointing start too, attracting smaller crowds than in previous years.","The thinktank is part of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the charity run by Matthew Taylor, who wrote a gig economy review for Theresa May when she was prime minister.

"The embattled US aircraft maker Boeing has reportedly sent US regulators “troubling communications” related to the development of the 737 MAX – on the same day that the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was forced to step aside. According to a senior Boeing executive, the documents include new messages from Mark Forkner, a senior company test pilot who complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of Boeing’s MCAS anti-stall system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Seattle Times that the Forkner communications contain the same kind of “trash talking” about Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) regulators as the earlier messages released in October. The release is likely to deepen the sense of crisis enveloping Boeing, which has taken more than $8bn in costs and lost more than 20% of its market value since the 737 variant was grounded in March following two crashes. Last week, the company said it would temporarily halt production of the troubled jet. Forkner, meanwhile, has reportedly hired his own criminal defense lawyers and invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid turning over records to the US Department of Justice, which has opened a criminal inquiry into the company’s handling of the 737 Max’s development. It was Forkner who requested that information about MCAS be omitted from flight manuals and pilot training, rendering the pilots of both the doomed Lion Air and Ethiopian flights helpless when the system kicked in, pushing the plane’s nose down repeatedly until they ultimately lost control. But the timing of the latest information release is likely to increase anger surrounding Boeing’s handling of the crisis, even as a new CEO, David Calhoun, takes the reins early next year. In a statement released on Monday, Boeing said that under the “new leadership”, Boeing “will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA, other global regulators and its customers”. But the latest drop of documents could complicate those intentions, and further challenge its relationship with regulators.","Boeing is a troubled US aircraft maker.

"The aerospace giant already angered the FAA by failing to turn over the Forkner messages for eight months because of the criminal investigation into how the plane was originally approved for service. “The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately upon its discovery,” the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also reportedly further vexed by Muilenburg’s predictions that the 737 Max would imminently be cleared to return to service, which it regarded as placing pressure on the agency to approve Boeing’s MCAS software fix even as it was taking a hit to its reputation for being too cozy with the plane maker. Last month, Muilenburg was reportedly called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator, Steve Dickson, and dressed down for applying perceived pressure on the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg’s efforts to take responsibility for the 737 debacle, and to apologize for its tragic consequences, fell flat with lawmakers, the public and grieving families, costing him his job. During congressional testimony, Muilenburg offered muddled responses to lawmaker’s demands for clarity on the development and approval of the 737 Max, and why it had not been immediately grounded after the first crash in Indonesia. “You’re not trying to Jedi mind-trick us here today on this committee?” the Democrat Dina Titus challenged. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to receive $26.5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. His payout could reach as high as $58.5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 annually and Boeing stock worth another $13.3m.

""The FAA is also disappointed that Boeing did not bring this document to our attention immediately after it was discovered,"" the regulator said in a statement on 18 October. The regulator was also a bit more sceptical of Muilenburg's predictions. He predicted the 737 Max would soon be cleared to return to service. The regulator thought this was a pressure to approve Boeing's software fix. This pressure came even though the agency was too close to Boeing. Last month, Muilenburg was called to a meeting in Washington with the FAA administrator Steve Dickson and dressed down for pushing the regulator. An internal FAA memo written by Dickson and reviewed by the Wall Street Journal said the FAA would not work to any schedule. Separately, it signaled it would not allow the Max to fly again until 2020. Muilenburg tried to take responsibility for the 737 accident. He also apologized for its tragic consequences. His efforts failed with the politicians, the public and grieving families. This cost him his job. Muilenburg testified before Congress. He sounded sloppy to the lawmakers. They wanted to know what the 737 Max was like and what it was like. They also asked why it wasn't grounded immediately after the first crash in Indonesia. Still, Muilenburg, 55, is in line to get $26. 5m in cash and stock as part of his exit package. He could get up to $58. 5m, depending on how it is structured, according to an SEC filing, including a pension of $807,000 a year and Boeing stock worth another $13. 3m. In a statement on Monday, Boeing’s board said it had decided that “a change in leadership” was necessary to restore confidence.

"The Chinese proverb is “be careful what you wish for”. My own adapted version is “be careful what you vote for”. I make no apology for having devoted so many columns to what on Thursday became the lost cause of Remain. The pro-European cause in this country has, alas, suffered from a colossal failure of leadership. The failure to make the case for our EU membership goes back a long way, as does the drip-drip of the vile anti-European campaign in the Murdoch press, and the obvious suspects in other sections of the media. The sequence of events was well brought out in Denis MacShane’s prophetic book Brexit – How Britain Will Leave Europe in 2015. (What lies in store is outlined both in MacShane’s latest volume, Brexiternity, and Sir Ivan Rogers’s recent magisterial lecture at Glasgow University.) As MacShane wrote in 2015: “The referendum on Europe is not on the benefits or cost of EU membership, but a wider protest about economic and social change which appears inside Britain to produce as many losers as winners.” It was always easy to blame “Brussels” for policies that became controversial, even when those policies were initiated by successive UK governments themselves. One of the leading perpetrators of lies about Europe was, of course, the Telegraph’s former Brussels correspondent himself: Boris Johnson. Johnson is such a master of what his putative hero Winston Churchill called “terminological inexactitudes” that nothing he claimed during the campaign or the morning of his victory can be taken at face value. “One-nation Conservatism”? Governing for the interests of those northerners who have “lent him their votes”? Pull the other one! How does that compare with his plans for deregulation, closer alignment with Trump’s America, and the opportunities for profiting from Brexit to which his financial backers look forward? As Rogers said in his Glasgow lecture, Johnson’s claim that we will “not suffer any downside in terms of market access into easily our biggest market for goods and services … is clearly untrue. It does not get any truer through endless repetition.” The nation has been the victim of a gigantic con trick on the part of the Leave campaign.","The Chinese proverb is ""be careful what you want"".

"The nonsensical propaganda about “getting Brexit done” was finally too much for the counsellor in the British embassy in Washington who resigned recently because she could no longer face peddling a misleading line. But back to failures of leadership: Jeremy Corbyn’s failure was on an epic scale. Reputedly a Leaver himself, he made a huge mistake in thinking that, by equivocating over the referendum, he could somehow please those supposedly natural Labour voters in the Midlands and the north who had voted Leave in the referendum. The election showed that too many of them merely laughed in his face. It seems that the election was also a referendum on Corbyn. There has been, and will continue to be, endless speculation about the reasons why the electorate distrusted him even more than Johnson. But historically there seems to me a simple, fundamental cause, whatever the deficiencies in Corbyn personally. In the early 1980s the sensible centre of the Labour party fought the extreme left – then known as the Militant Tendency, not Momentum – and saw them off. The late Denis Healey played a crucial role, as did Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley. And the moderate left in Britain and continental Europe watched the failure of President Mitterrand’s experiment with “socialism in one country” between 1981 and 1983 and learned the lesson. Among those who learned the lesson was Mitterrand himself. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown also took note. Alas, this time the extreme left captured the Labour party, with the results we now see. For reasons that I fail to understand, Corbyn and his allies, such as Seumas Milne, believe that the EU is some kind of capitalist conspiracy. Despite the many doubts about Corbyn himself, if he had not equivocated and campaigned vigorously in favour of Remain and a referendum with no ifs or buts, there might well have been a hung parliament and deals which could have contained Corbyn’s wilder plans. Also, the hapless Jo Swinson should not have made the strategic mistake of ruling out the second referendum her party had previously espoused.

"The Brexit and Conservative party is going to “deliver” Brexit. But so far from “getting Brexit done”, the election result means that Brexit has only just begun.

"As we wrap up the year, I thought it would be fun to look back at all the columns I have written for the Guardian and pull out the five stories that were my favorites. Why are these my favorites? Mostly because these stories captured the best and worst aspects of running a small business this year. Female-owned businesses: the US economy’s quiet success story A report earlier this year found that 42% of all firms are female-owned and women started 1,817 businesses a day in the past year. My daughter is currently watching Mad Men for the first time and was shocked at how women were treated in the workplace a mere 50 years ago. To me, that just shows how much things have changed. Unfortunately – as I also wrote here – the out-of-date attitudes of some men in positions of power continue to challenge female advancement and opportunities in the workplace. But, there’s still been a lot of progress. As I wrote: “The fact is that women have made significant gains not only in the workplace but in entrepreneurship. Of course there is still a long way to go to achieve equality. But, compared with the data from 10 or 20 years before, there’s no dispute that the environment continues to improve.” Unlimited vacation isn’t as crazy as it sounds – and it can save you money I like reporting on small business news, but I also enjoy sharing good tactics that can help small business owners grow. One of these tactics involves unlimited vacation. 2019 was a year of very tight unemployment and just about every small business owner I know struggled to find and keep good employees. So what about unlimited vacation? Don’t laugh. My report found that unlimited vacation plans can be a potential great benefit and not as costly or as risky as they may seem. As I wrote: “... the vacation benefits you offer should best suit the interests of your employees and your company’s culture. An unlimited paid time-off plan may not be the right thing for your business. But considering some of the potential financial benefits, you should at least be seriously considering it.” Could this be the worst cafe in the world? I know I’m supposed to cover American businesses, but this little restaurant in an out-of-the-way place in New Zealand was too irresistible to ignore. “Just how bad is the customer service at the Springfield Store and Cafe?” I wrote.","I will pull out five favorite stories.

"“So bad that people have been reportedly chased out of the cafe and others were forced to leave in tears after being abused by staff members. So bad that the police have actually been called and so bad that some of the local residents boycott the restaurant. ‘It’s an embarrassment to our community,’ one resident said. ‘You don’t have to talk to too many people before you come across somebody who’s had a bad experience there.

And kills it! It’s a smart entrepreneur named Pinky Cole, a food truck owner who opened her first brick-and-mortar vegan eatery called Slutty Vegan at the beginning of the year and saw more than 1,200 people line up outside its doors on its very first day. Combining great food with an even better name, Cole’s restaurant has been a hit in 2019, attracting celebrities such as Shaquille O’Neal. She’s also laying the plans for more locations in 2020.

I’m thrilled for all the female entrepreneurs who are finally making their mark, but can we still give a small shoutout to us old people?

She opened her first brick-and-mortar vegan eatery called Slutty Vegan at the beginning of the year. On its very first day, more than 1,200 people lined up outside its doors. Cole's restaurant has been a hit in 2019, with celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal. She’s also laying the plans for more locations in 2020. Who runs America's small businesses? ""You are older people. You are still in charge."" Please also recognize old people. The fact is that America’s small businesses are still dominated by people in their 50s and 60s, and if you’re marketing to small businesses, don’t ignore this demographic."

"In a parallel political universe, Ofwat’s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets. None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a “politicised” regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)? We’ll have to wait eight weeks – the permitted period for an appeal – to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine. First, Ofwat’s review is pitched as the “toughest ever”, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That’s not evidence of politicisation; it’s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat’s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by £50 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks. Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its “draft” and “final” calculations. Companies, in aggregate, will be allowed about £1.5bn of extra expenditure to meet performance targets. The concession is not huge in the context of a £51bn spending programme, but it’s a softening. Third, the new regime will only look “tough” to the laggards, judged by efficiency. Note how the share price of Severn Trent, one of three companies that got top-of-the-class “fast track” status during Ofwat’s review, is within pennies of its all-time high. Its shareholders see little to frighten them. Fourth, an appeal to the CMA is not a one-way bet. The competition regulator is allowed to conclude that Ofwat should have been harder.","In a parallel political universe, Ofwat’s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday.

"That thought ought to concentrate minds in the boardrooms of the four companies – Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames and Yorkshire – that are thought most likely to appeal. It’s time for them to accept that, in a privatised but regulated system, owners have to take a hit sometimes. On – then off – the buses It’s hard to keep up with transport firm FirstGroup’s view of its best strategy. Back in May, the “future emphasis” for the group was going to be First Student and First Transit, its two North American bus contractors, since they had “the greatest potential to generate sustainable value and growth over time”. Now both operations may be sold. What’s prompted the U-turn? One can point to the arrival of David Martin as chairman in August but, since he seemed to endorse the May vision only last month, the latest development looks to be a lobbying triumph for activist investor Coast Capital, aided these days by fellow investor Robert Tchenguiz. The duo demanded a sale of all US assets, not just the Greyhound coaching business, a few weeks ago; now they may get it. A UK-only future would be a mighty come-down for FirstGroup, which can currently call itself one of the world’s largest transport companies with 100,000 employees. Indeed, even within the UK, the future of the bus division is unclear, as FirstGroup is exploring what form of “separation” is possible while meeting pension obligations. If the buses were also to exit along with the US assets, all that would be left would be the UK rail business, from which FirstGroup seemed to be contemplating an orderly retreat only a year ago. Then it won the West Coast Partnership franchise and all is now apparently right with rail. One can view this strategic soul-searching as an exercise in “rationalisation”, the polite term for a break-up. It’s hard, though, to escape the feeling that there’s a simpler alternative to uncertain deal-making: just run the businesses better. Going up … ?

"With its army of perfectly groomed and manicured shop assistants, the department store beauty hall has traditionally been the backbone of a £2.5bn trade in expensive lipsticks, face creams or perfumes. But cosmetics sales have plummeted this year as high street shutdowns, coupled with the shift to home-working, has prompted many people to ditch their makeup bags. Sales of the designer brands sold via glossy counters in department stores are down by more than 40% this year, a decrease worth almost £500m, according to the market researcher NPD. The decline is even bigger if you throw in the £180m hit to sales of cheaper lipsticks and eyeshadows bought alongside groceries in supermarkets. Women are simply wearing less makeup, said Alexia Inge, the co-founder of the Cult Beauty website. “The lockdown expedited trends that were already happening. People were already starting to take a different approach to makeup from the Insta-glam layer-upon-layer [look].” The so-called “lipstick index” is often used as a barometer of consumer confidence during periods of economic turmoil. The term, which was coined by the former Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder in the early 2000s, refers to the usual resiliency of cosmetics with makeup seen as an affordable indulgence when bigger purchases are out of reach. But the index never saw Covid-19 coming, with its mandatory face-coverings that mean no one can even see your lips, let alone what colour they are. During the lockdown, demand for products many would once have considered an essential part of their daily beauty routine – such as foundation and lipstick – was down by more than 70%. “Everyone likes to roll out Lauder’s lipstick effect … but lipstick sales are probably the worst of any category right now,” said Inge. Instead, she added, we should look at skincare, which is the “makeup equivalent” of the leisurewear people have been wearing at home during the pandemic. While Cult Beauty’s lipstick sales were down 8%, its skincare sales have more than doubled.

"Its sales of skincare, body and hair products are up 234% this year, as people opt to spend time caring for their skin rather than applying makeup.

This was said by June Jensen-Mills. She is head of UK beauty at market researchers NPD. But store sales will return in 2021. “I believe that bricks and mortar will go back to being important,” she said. “People will want to meet up with friends, try things, have a coffee. Debenhams is a major beauty retailer. When it closed, its customers went to other similar stores. There are also new powerful forces in the industry as the glitzy websites of blockbuster brands such as Charlotte Tilbury compete with the department stores that are also their business partners. Shoppers love the beauty hall. They like to find new brands and try textures, colors and scents. Coronavirus restrictions have changed this. In many cases it is not possible. But department stores brands are fighting back with innovative new ways of selling, such as virtual masterclasses and compiling “discovery boxes” of sample-sized products."
"Last week John Lewis and Charlotte Tilbury broke the Guinness World Records’ title for the UK’s largest ever beauty masterclass after 10,000 people signed up to “brush along at home” to create a “timeless 90s supermodel-inspired look”. Consumers may be looking for “simplicity” now but their feelings may change in 2021. “I have a strong feeling that once we come out of lockdown, and the bars and discos are open again, things will pick up,” said Jensen-Mills. “People will think ‘I’ve had an awful year and I want to make myself feel and look great’. Let’s just slap on loads of foundation and lipstick.”","Last week John Lewis and Charlotte Tilbury broke a Guinness World Record. They were the biggest beauty masterclass in the UK.

"Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than scheduled before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19 border closures. The Japanese carmaker said it was expecting shortages of parts as a result of transport delays, after France’s 48-hour ban on accompanied freight or cargo from Britain led to queues of lorries miles long stuck near Dover. Toyota said it had decided to bring forward the “planned seasonal stop” at its engine plant in Deeside in north Wales and its factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire, where it makes the Corolla. About 3,000 people are employed at the two plants. The Deeside site will close for Christmas on Tuesday and the Burnaston plant on Wednesday. Its French site will also stop production two days earlier than planned. The European factories would ordinarily have closed for an annual shutdown on Christmas Eve and remained shut until 4 January. Toyota said it wanted to “help ensure the safety and security of our employees and all our stakeholders, particularly our logistics partners and in consideration of society’s wider needs”. The car manufacturer said it had taken the decision “in light of the traffic bans that a growing number of countries have issued for travel from the UK and due to the uncertain nature of how long the borders will be closed for logistics activities”. The extended shutdown caps a tumultuous year for the automotive industry, which halted production in the spring as the first wave of the pandemic took hold. The French government is expected to make an announcement on Tuesday about reopening transport links with the UK. Paris failed to lift its 48-hour ban on freight and passengers from Britain over fears about the new coronavirus strain, despite a phone call on Monday evening between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. France is one of more than 40 countries that have suspended flights and trains from the UK, including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Turkey and Canada. However, the suspension of cross-Channel transport has caused the most disruption in and around British ports, which were already struggling with increased workloads because of the arrival of Christmas goods, companies stockpiling ahead of Brexit and coronavirus restrictions.","Toyota will stop production at its British and French plants earlier than planned before Christmas because of the chaos caused by Covid-19.

"Shaftesbury, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has slumped to a £700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End braces for tougher Covid-19 restrictions. The company, which owns parts of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, has been hit by the sharp fall in the number of tourists and office workers coming into the capital. It said vacancies at its shops, restaurants and offices had nearly tripled to 10.2% in the year to 30 September. As tenants struggled to pay their rent, Shaftesbury’s net income fell by 24% to £74.3 . It collected only 53% of the rent due in the second half of the year. This resulted in an annual loss after tax of £699.5m, compared with a profit of £26m the previous year. Shaftesbury wrote down the value of its portfolio by 18.3% to £3.1bn, as the amount of empty space in the West End increased, rental income fell and physical distancing measures reduced demand from retail and office tenants for more space. Brian Bickell, the Shaftesbury chief executive, said: “Rarely in history has the world seen such widespread disruption to normal patterns of life. Only now are we seeing the first positive signs that conditions will begin to improve in the year ahead.” Shaftesbury said its leasing activity had declined sharply since February due to the pandemic and was below normal levels, although there had been a pickup in inquiries in recent weeks. The pandemic has also forced landlords to rewrite lease agreements to help tenants get through the crisis, and Shaftesbury moved permanently to monthly rents for most commercial tenants from October. The company said its rental and service charge support for tenants was likely to continue through 2021, “with our occupiers having reduced income in the important period leading up to Christmas and into the new year, which traditionally has provided them with liquidity buffers to withstand the normally slower quarter to March”. London is among the areas that enter tier 3 restrictions on Wednesday, which means hotels, pubs, bars and restaurants have to close again and can only do takeaways and deliver. Shaftesbury gave a gloomy outlook for next year, predicting that pandemic control measures were “likely for much of 2021”.","Shaftesbury, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has fallen to a £700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End faces tougher Covid-19 restrictions.

"Britain’s economy is suffering increasing damage from the rapid growth in Covid infections, renewed lockdown measures, and turmoil over Brexit at the end of the worst year for growth in three centuries, according to a Guardian analysis. With negotiations going down to the wire amid vast tailbacks at Dover before the Brexit transition expires on New Year’s Eve, the latest figures from the UK economy show stalling growth, falling retail sales, and redundancies rising at the fastest rate since records began. In a month that started with a burst of optimism as a British woman became the first patient in the world to receive the coronavirus vaccine, December is ending with the pandemic surging to a fresh peak and Boris Johnson’s government imposing tougher lockdown measures before Christmas. To counter the emergence of a faster-spreading Covid variant in the UK, and as Brexit talks intensify, the French ban on freight movements has led to chaos in Kent days before a no-deal Brexit could trigger renewed turmoil. Official figures had shown the British economy recovered from lockdown this spring at a faster rate than first anticipated, amid hopes that a vaccine could bring an early end to the crisis. However, economists now forecast a double-dip recession and tougher lockdowns lasting into 2021 before the vaccine can be rolled out widely enough. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said Brexit – with or without a trade deal with Brussels – would hit an already weak UK economy at the start of next year. Writing in the Guardian, he said: “It does seem to me to be the worst decision in peacetime any country in the world has made in a thousand years. Lines of lorries at Dover and Folkestone do not augur well for what is to come, even before Boris Johnson cancelled Christmas.” Since the onset of the pandemic, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it.

"In the past month, there have been some bright spots for the economy, including a recovery in business activity in early December after the second national lockdown in England. Tougher restrictions in the autumn appear to have had less of an impact on growth and jobs than during the first wave of the pandemic. Official figures show Britain’s economy staged a faster recovery in the third quarter of the year than was first estimated, after a rapid return to work after the first lockdown. However, official growth figures also show the economy started sinking towards a double-dip recession even before Covid restrictions were reimposed in November. The Bank of England has warned the economy will shrink in the final months of 2020 and could remain weaker than expected at the start of 2021, as controls are kept in place to handle rising infections before the Covid vaccine can be rolled out widely. In response to the renewed period of economic pain, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unexpectedly extended the furlough scheme until the end of April, a month longer than planned. Use of the flagship wage subsidy programme, which has cost the government almost £50bn so far, doubled in November to about 5 million workers, reflects the intense pressure facing companies. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of people being made redundant reached a record high in October, at a time when the government was winding down furlough before a last-minute U-turn to extend the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2.6 million next year when the scheme ends. Blanchflower said: “The issue is whether these jobs – many in pubs, clubs and restaurants – return after the furlough payments stop. But many jobs won’t return, if there are long-run changes in behaviour after the pandemic as expected.”","The past month had some good things for the economy.

The flagship wage subsidy programme has cost the government almost £50bn so far. It used to be used by about 5 million workers in November. This is the pressure that companies are under. Sunak announced plans to hold a budget on 3 March to set out the next stage of the government’s economic response to the pandemic. However, business groups and Labour have warned additional support is required to support firms and workers during a period of extended lockdown restrictions. The number of jobs was high in October. This happened when the government was winding down furlough. Then the government made a last-minute U-turn. It extended the scheme. Unemployment is expected to hit 2. 6 million next year when the scheme ends."
"The former owner of Norton Motorcycles will be forced to pay back about £14m missing from the company’s employee retirement fund, after being refused permission to appeal against a pensions ombudsman’s ruling. Stuart Garner, who acquired the classic marque in 2008 and was feted for years by a series of UK government ministers, was told by the regulator in June to refund three retirement funds he controlled as trustee, following an ombudsman ruling that he had acted dishonestly. The ombudsman’s decision followed an investigation triggered by claims brought by 30 members that Garner had repeatedly failed to return their funds when they were due. The Pension Schemes Act requires trustees to transfer pensions within six months of an application. The court’s refusal to entertain Garner’s request to appeal is another blow for the businessman, who appears to have been pushed a step closer to personal bankruptcy. He is already the subject of a personal bankruptcy petition filed by Leicester city council. The repayment of the £14m to the pension holders, the vast majority of whom were never Norton employees, had been on hold while the court considered Garner’s request for permission to appeal. In an August order delaying the payment, Mr Justice Fancourt said: “The sum likely to be payable … is extremely large and it is readily understandable that [Garner] will not be able to pay it and that, as a result, he is liable to be made bankrupt.” In his latest judgment refusing an appeal, however, Fancourt stated: “There could have been no good reason to delay the payment of compensation unless there was compelling evidence that it would be provided by other means within the timescale specified by the ombudsman.” Garner has been granted permission to appeal against a further £180,000 in distress payments to 30 of the scheme’s 228 members, to whom he had repeatedly failed to return funds when they were due. The businessman’s law firm said: “Mr Garner has been granted permission to appeal the inconvenience award, and has renewed his application for permission to appeal in respect of the refusal.” Garner, who was the trustee of three Norton pension funds, invested all of the members’ savings into his own company, but Norton slumped into administration on 29 January.","The former owner of Norton Motorcycles must pay back about £14m.

"The ombudsman’s determination in the summer stated: “The trustee has acted dishonestly and in breach of his duty of no conflict, his duty not to profit and his duty to act with prudence.” The decision followed a Guardian and ITV News investigation in January that showed how 228 “ordinary working people” had had their entire pension pots invested into Norton shares after they had been duped by a fraudster. Garner received the retirement savings during 2012 and 2013, after a scam that resulted in a promoter, Simon Colfer, being convicted of fraud in 2018 for the way he had sold the scheme. Two further Garner associates involved in setting up the Norton pensions schemes, Andrew Meeson and Peter Bradley, were convicted of a separate tax fraud in 2013, when they reclaimed £5m of tax rebates from fictitious pension contributions. Court documents from that trial show that £990,000 of the fraud proceeds were loaned to Garner to acquire Norton in 2008. Garner denies wrongdoing and has said he considers himself a victim because he did not know he was dealing with fraudsters.","The ombudsman decided in the summer.

"Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are much more likely than white people to work in hospitality, one of the sectors hardest hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic as restaurants, bars and other venues have been shut for months during the lockdowns. About one in 12 (8%) workers from BAME backgrounds are employed in hospitality roles. That compares with about one in 20 (5%) white British workers, research from the Resolution Foundation shows. Overall, 300,000 people from BAME backgrounds work in hospitality. The thinktank’s report found that even before the pandemic hit, hospitality was one of the lowest paying sectors in the economy, with a typical hourly pay of £8.72. It said that 23% of hospitality workers were paid at or below the national living wage. The research found that BAME workers in the sector also faced “pay penalties” – pay gaps that account for workers’ age, qualifications, experience, and the kinds of jobs they do – relative to white British workers. “Crucially, these pay penalties are bigger than the raw pay gaps found in official earnings data – suggesting that the extent of disadvantage is bigger than previously thought,” the report said. BAME men were paid 65p an hour less than white British men on average, the report found. BAME women were also underpaid compared with white British women but the gap was less severe. The report found that while hospitality as a whole disproportionately employed young people – over a third of its workforce were aged 16-24 – this was not always the case for BAME workers. For example, the typical age of a Bangladeshi worker in hospitality was 42 – higher than the typical age for Bangladeshi workers across the whole economy (35), and higher than white British workers in hospitality (28). Indian workers in hospitality were among the highest paid ethnic group per hour (£8.96) and among the most likely to be in high-paying occupations (28%) such as hotel and restaurant managers. This corresponds with 41% of Indian hospitality workers holding a degree. In comparison, one in four Bangladeshi hospitality workers had no qualifications and typically earned 12% less than Indian hospitality workers, at £7.85 an hour.","Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are much more likely than white people to work in hospitality.

"Nye Cominetti, the senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “As workers from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately likely to work in hospitality, a significant number of workers risk moving into unemployment when the furlough scheme ends in the spring. “The government should bear that in mind for the jobs support programmes it is providing.” A report by the British Beer &amp; Pubs Association and the consultancy Oxford Economics has previously warned that 291,000 jobs in the hospitality trade could be lost as a result of coronavirus restrictions.

"Family-owned Welsh brewer SA Brain &amp; Co has handed over the running of its 156 pubs to Marston’s, saving 1,300 jobs, after the coronavirus pandemic threatened their closure. Brains, whose pubs are mainly based in south and west Wales, said it had come “under significant financial pressure” during the pandemic, as restrictions mean pubs must remain closed except for takeaway and delivery. The company closed its entire pub estate on 4 December after the announcement of a ban on alcohol sales and enforced 6pm closing across Wales to try to contain a worsening Covid-19 outbreak. Remaining open under those restrictions was “not a viable option”, Brains said. SA Brain &amp; Co was established in 1882 in Cardiff, and became Wales’s biggest brewer and pubs company while remaining under family ownership. John Rhys, the company chairman who oversaw the deal, is the great-grandson of founder Samuel Arthur Brain. Before the pandemic, the pubs included in the deal made £14m a year in core earnings. Marston’s will take over the pubs in February, mostly under 25-year leases from Brains. The annual rent on the pubs was £5.5m. The pubs will be run under the Brains brand, and will continue to sell its beer, which is brewed at a facility in Cardiff Bay that was opened in March 2019. Before that Brains was made in breweries in Cardiff’s city centre. Rhys said: “We know and trust Marston’s to be excellent custodians of our pubs and, while this is not a decision we have taken lightly, we are confident that our pubs and our pubs teams will thrive under their stewardship. “Furthermore, this transaction enables Brains to recapitalise its balance sheet and continue its long heritage as an independent entity, preserving this great Welsh business for generations to come.” Marston’s, formerly known as Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries until a 2007 rebrand, runs about 1,400 pubs across the UK, including 106 in Wales.

"Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite an overall drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home prompted consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres. Data from Barclaycard shows spending at independent food and drink shops, including off-licences, butchers and bakeries, jumped 28.6% in 2020 compared with a year earlier. In contrast, total consumer spending fell 7.1%, as social distancing rules left shoppers with fewer opportunities to spend on overseas holidays, hospitality and in city centres. Barclaycard, which covers nearly half of the UK’s credit and debit card transactions, found that while spending on essential goods such as groceries rose by 4.1% compared with 2019, non-essential spending fell 11.3%. Department stores were particularly hard hit, with spending down 17.2%, while clothing retailers experienced a 15.6% slump, leading to the financial problems at the likes of Debenhams and the Topshop owner, Arcadia. However, bricks and mortar discounters had a 25.4% increase, as Britons facing furlough and job cuts sought value for money deals. Consumers forced to spend more time at home turned to DIY projects to spruce up their living space. Pent-up demand after the reopening of non-essential shops in June pushed overall spending at DIY and home goods stores up 9.8% for the year. Furniture retailers reported a 5.3% rise, as consumers invested in big ticket items. Britons treated themselves – as well as friends and family they could not see – to flowers throughout the year, with spending at florists rising 22.7%. Crafts and hobby spending increased 9.8%, and pets were given extra attention with vet and pet retail increasing 10.7%. But the report also shows how much restaurants suffered despite Rishi Sunak’s “eat out to help out” initiative over the summer. Restrictions throughout the rest of the year contributed to a 47% drop in restaurant spending, while bars and pubs took a 36.7% hit. However, Covid restrictions contributed to a 49.1% rise in spending on online takeaway orders, while meal subscription services jumped 62.4%. Demand for at-home entertainment pushed spending on digital subscriptions up 31.5%, while money spent on electronics including game consoles rose 10.8%.","Britain’s independent shops had a sales boost in 2020 despite a general drop in retail spending, as Covid travel restrictions and working from home made it easier for consumers to shop on local high streets instead of city centres.

"The plus-size clothing brand Evans has been bought out of administration in a £23m deal that will result in the closure of all its stores and concessions with the potential loss of hundreds of jobs . The chain is the first part of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia Group to be sold off, marking the beginning of the breakup of his fashion empire, which also includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge. City Chic Collective, an Australian retailer, plans to operate Evans, which made sales of £26m online and via wholesale last year, as an online-only brand. That will mean the closure of more than 100 Evans concessions and outlets within other Arcadia stores. Five standalone stores will permanently close with the loss of 25 jobs. The concessions and other outlets will not close immediately but hundreds of jobs are at risk at those outlets. Arcadia, which employs 13,000 people at about 500 outlets, collapsed into administration last month as high street lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic piled on pressure after years of flagging sales amid heavy competition from rivals such as Boohoo and Primark. Bids for all the brands are due to be filed on Monday, with Topshop expected to attract offers of up to £200m. Bidders are thought to include the online specialist Boohoo, the fashion and homewares group Next, and Authentic Brands, the owner of the US department store Barneys. Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, formerly known as Sports Direct, is also thought to be interested in the smaller Arcadia brands. Administrators from Deloitte said on Monday there had been “significant expressions of interest for all brands”. They said they did not expect to provide a further update on the process until January. City Chic Collective said it had bought Evans as part of a plan to extend its portfolio of plus-size brands, which include City Chic and Hips &amp; Curves, into Europe. It operates in Australia, New Zealand and the US, where it bought the Avenue brand last year. The company already had a relationship with Evans, which has sold City Chic products via its website for the past five years. “Our vision has always been to lead a world of curves,” said Phil Ryan, the chief executive of City Chic Collective.","Evans is a plus-size clothing brand.

"Retail sales fell by 3.8% in November on the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown in England and restrictions elsewhere in the UK shut much of the high street. Ending a six-month run of rising sales, the figures revealed the impact of the pandemic on the sector as the infection rate increased across the country. A 19% fall in clothing sales followed the closure of most department stores and non-essential shops. A government message that workers should stay at home if they could caused car journeys to slump and petrol sales to follow suit, with a 16.6% decline. The only bright spot for retailers was an increase in the sale of household goods of 1.6% as shoppers went online to stock up for Christmas. Supermarkets and food stores increased sales by 3.1%. Analysts said it was no surprise the lockdown bolstered online shopping to a record total of 31.4% of all spending, after an increase of almost 75% since November 2019. The Office for National Statistics said 90% of businesses continued to trade in some form through the month, mostly via a click-and-collect service. But only 68.8% of department stores continued trading. Meanwhile, many online retailers reported a boom in sales, as they did during the UK-wide lockdown in spring, though heavy discounting helped to keep the tills ringing. The ONS said this week price-cutting by clothing retailers last month pushed UK inflation down to 0.3%, from 0.7% a month earlier. The Bank of England’s inflation target is 2%. Aled Patchett, the head of retail at Lloyds Bank, said: “November’s sales highlight once again the polarising effect of Covid-19 on retail. Sectors like grocery and homeware perform well – and should be expected to have a strong finish to the year – while others including big-name high street brands fall foul of significantly reduced footfall. “Despite most shoppers having wrapped up their Covid Christmas shopping online this year, shops – particularly in smaller towns – will be hoping that the vaccine rollout inspires greater consumer confidence in the new year as people return to city centres for both work and play.” In October, a 6.4% increase in online sales spurred a 1.2% rise in the total volume of retail spending, mainly driven by shoppers rushing to buy early Christmas presents before the second lockdown in England.","Retail sales fell by 3. 8% in November on the previous month as the coronavirus lockdown in England and restrictions in other parts of the UK closed much of the high street.

"The UK public’s appetite for eating out has plunged to its weakest since the spring amid growing evidence of the impact of the Omicron variant on the hospitality sector during its crucial pre-Christmas period. The number of seated diners fell by 14 percentage points in the week ending 20 December to 88% of the level in the same period of 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the weekly digest of flash economic indicators from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Using data from the online restaurant booking site OpenTable and other sources, the ONS said Britons were eating out less and working from home more in response to rising infection rates and the government’s plan B measures. Amid widespread reports of bookings being cancelled, the drop in the number of diners in the latest week was the sharpest since early September and the lowest level since restaurants reopened indoors in England, Scotland and Wales in May after last winter’s lockdown. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. Restaurants in London have been especially hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite an eight-point drop on the week, the number of diners stood at 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS said the number of firms reporting staff working from home in the latest two weeks had risen by two points to 14%, with a marked impact on businesses reliant on consumers. Transactions at Pret a Manger sandwich outlets were lower in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in regional towns remained above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped by 29 points to barely 50% of the January 2020 level. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with footfall in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level – a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago.

It was also the lowest level since restaurants opened indoors in May. It was also the first time the weekly comparison with 2019 has dropped below 100% since May. London's restaurants have been particularly hard hit by Omicron, with the number of diners in the latest week falling 18 points to 57% of the level in the same period of 2019. In Manchester, despite a seven-point drop on the week, the number of diners was 104% of the level in the run-up to Christmas 2019. The ONS reported on firms with staff working from home. This number increased by two points to 14% in the latest two weeks. The increase had a big impact on some businesses. These are businesses that depend on consumers. Pret a Manger sandwich shops were less busy in the week ending 16 December than in January 2020 in six of seven urban locations, with London again the most affected city. While trade in the region was above pre-pandemic levels, sales in the capital dropped 29 points to barely 50% of January 2020. The ONS report showed retailers doing less badly than restaurants, with sales in the latest week 81% of its 2019 level - a drop of only one percentage point. Credit and debt card payment purchases were up 4% on a year ago. Earlier this week, the chancellor Rishi Sunak announced an emergency £1bn package to help businesses struggling with the impact of Omicron."

"Ikea has increased the price of its flat-pack furniture by up to 50%, blaming supply chain costs caused by Covid-19, in a move that will further stoke growing concern about the rising cost of living. After customers complained that prices appeared to have risen sharply after Christmas, the retailer said it was no longer able to absorb increased costs and was passing them on to consumers. An Ikea spokesperson tweeted: “Unfortunately, there has been a significant increase in costs across the supply chain, including in raw materials, transport and logistics. As this is still ongoing, it is necessary to increase prices across many of our products.” Archived versions of Ikea’s website from as recently as October showed significant price increases, including a Malm desk that has gone up from £99 to £150, a jump of more than 50%. A Jokkmokk table with four chairs is also up 50%, from £99 to £149, compared with earlier this year. A Hemnes daybed has gone up from £215 to £279, a 30% rise, while an Alex nine-drawer unit increased 35% from £85 to £115, according to archived versions of the Ikea website from earlier this year. A Kura children’s bed was up by 14% from £129 to £150, while Ikea’s Klippan sofa, one of the Swedish store’s most popular items, is £20 more expensive – a rise of 11% – at £199. Ikea confirmed that the company had raised prices across multiple countries and ranges. A spokesperson said: “Since the start of the pandemic, Ikea has managed to absorb the significant cost increases experienced across the supply chain while keeping prices as low and stable as we possibly can. Now, like many other retailers, we have had to raise our prices to mitigate the impact on our business. “Price increases vary but remain in line with what we are seeing globally at Ikea, which is approximately a 9% average increase across countries and the product range. Affordability remains at the heart of our business, and our focus will always be on continuing to offer quality, sustainable home furnishings at an affordable price for the many people.” Ikea warned earlier this year that prices would rise, citing factors including bottlenecks in shipping raw materials from Asia to Europe.","Ikea has raised the price of its flat-pack furniture by up to 50%.

"The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. Other interventions the industry would like to see considered include extending fuel grants and moving green levies from consumers’ bills into taxation. Trade body Energy UK said on Thursday that consumers could expect their bills to soar by as much as 50% from 1 April. While wholesale prices continue to climb steeply, the UK’s price cap on energy bills stops companies from immediately passing those costs on to their customers. The price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, has been at a record £1,277 Since 1 October. Ofgem is expected to raise the cap significantly on 1 April. EDF has said the cap could hit £2,000 by next October, when the cap is reviewed again. Analysts at Investec believe the expected bill increase in April would add 1.8 percentage points to inflation next year. On Thursday, the shadow energy minister, Ed Miliband, called on the government to stop families being “clobbered” with the increased cost of heating and powering their homes, by removing VAT on bills for six months. Spain has cut energy taxes, while Germany has slashed green levies on household bills, designed to support the development of renewable energy. But Energy UK said measures like these would save less than £300, significantly less than the expected £600 rise in the average annual bill when the price cap goes up. One plan being formulated by the energy industry to would involve a government-administered loan scheme to spread the impact of the price increases over several years.","The government will hold emergency meetings with the biggest energy suppliers in the UK.

"On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gave a mid-year economic update predicting a solid economic bounceback from Covid restrictions. We’ve looked under the hood to see what the treasury’s crystal ball says is in store for the economy, what might go wrong, and how government finances will fare if they’re right. Forecasts The budget papers project the Australian economy will grow in real terms by 3.75% in 2021-22 and 3.5% in 2022-23, before easing back to 2.25% and 2.5% in the final two years of the forward projections. The unemployment rate is tipped to fall to 4.25% in that time. The treasury thinks Australians will be ambitious with their pay demands and bosses generous in a bid to keep workers, because wages growth is supposed to take off from 2.25% in 2021-22 to 3.25% in 2024-25. Inflation is projected to reach and stay at the mid-point of the reserve bank’s target range (2.5%) in 2022-23. Assumptions The treasury has assumed that with more than 80% of Australians aged 16 and above now vaccinated, rates will climb to more than 90%. So far so good. But the rest of the assumptions are … a little rosy. The treasury assumed lockdowns will no longer be required, with “most domestic activity restrictions” lifted by the start of 2022 and only basic density restrictions in place. There may be “temporary strengthening of activity restrictions” to contain localised outbreaks – but these short, sharp lockdown-like restrictions are assumed to have no material impact on the outlook. Remaining state border restrictions are assumed to be lifted by early 2022 and the Omicron variant “is not assumed to significantly alter current reopening plans or require a reimposition of widespread health and activity restrictions”. Migrants will start returning from 2022, with international students ready to go for the first semester of next year. What could go wrong In a word: Covid. If a new variant of concern emerges (beyond Omicron) requiring more significant health responses, the international border could be closed for another six months and public health orders and precautionary behaviour could drive down spending.","On Thursday the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gave a mid-year economic update predicting a strong economic rebound from Covid restrictions.

"The treasury projects this could mean 1% is shaved off gross domestic product in 2021-22, and unemployment is about 1% higher. The rebound would instead come in the second half of 2022. The papers also note that revenue assumptions and nominal GDP are also sensitive to changes in the iron ore price, with a US$10 fall shaving $3.9bn off GDP this year and $0.9bn off tax receipts next financial year. If the government has to pay higher interest rates on bonds, then debt could blow out by a further 5.4% of GDP by 2032. $16bn of mystery spending The budget papers reveal that there is about $16bn of mystery spending over the next four years, consisting of decisions taken but not announced, or measures for which the cost is not-for-publication. That’s more than 10 times the size of mystery spending last year. The papers make it impossible to calculate the size of the war chest for announcements to be made before the election, by mixing in a bunch of commercially sensitive spending items like vaccine purchases. But a treasury official in the lockup suggested it was about half and half … so, an $8bn war chest for the election. There will also be $940m more revenue collected due to decisions taken but not announced or not for publication measures. Debt and deficit For a government previously concerned with the debt and deficit disaster, there is still red as far as the eye can see. The deficit is tipped to be $99.2bn in 2021-22, an improvement of $7.4bn since the budget despite the Delta lockdowns. The deficit will still be $57.5bn in 2024-25 (or 2.3% of GDP), and only shrinks to 1.8% of GDP in 2031-32. Net debt is projected to be 30.6% of GDP at June 2022, rising to a peak of 37.4% in 2025, then down to 35.5% in 2032.

"Britons are many times more likely to have experienced shortages of food and fuel than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll. Global supply chain problems prompted by the pandemic have disrupted the international trade network since the summer, with transport backlogs combining with labour shortages to create scarcities of various goods around the world. The government has argued that the shortages are part of a worldwide pattern and no worse in the UK than elsewhere, although logistics experts and other professionals – particularly in the food sector - have said the problems are amplified in Britain by a shortage of east European workers, including drivers, since Brexit. The YouGov poll showed residents of the UK were multiple times more likely to have experienced, or to know people who have experienced, shortages of food and fuel than people in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Denmark, and somewhat more likely to have experienced them than those in the US. Asked in early December whether they had personally experienced any scarcity of foodstuffs in recent weeks, 56% of respondents in the UK said yes, while 9% said they had not personally experienced any but knew people who had. The corresponding figures in the US were 49% and 10%, but in continental Europe, the proportion of people who said they had been personally affected was between three and nine times lower: 18% in Germany, 16% in France, 12% in Sweden, 8% in Denmark, 7% and 6% in Italy. The proportion saying they knew people who had experienced food shortages ranged from 13% in France to 8% in Denmark and Italy – where 58% of respondents said they were not even aware that supply chain problems had led to food shortages. The UK was also the only country where substantial numbers of people said they had experienced fuel shortages in recent weeks, since the crisis in September and October. One in three Britons (33%) said they had personally experienced a recent scarcity of fuel, compared with no more than 10% in any other country. Only 8% of German respondents, 7% of those in France and 5% of those in Italy said they had been personally experienced fuel scarcity, with 37%, 38% and 53% respectively saying they had not even heard of the issue – compared with just 11% of respondents in Britain.","Britons are often more likely to have had food and fuel shortages than people in half a dozen EU member states, according to a poll.

"Just Eat has entered the fast grocery delivery market by partnering with Asda in its first tie-up with a supermarket in the UK. From January, Just Eat customers will be able to add a range of products to their baskets starting with five Asda stores, with the exact locations to be announced in the new year. “We live in an on-demand world,” said Andrew Kenny, the UK managing director of Just Eat. “We want to make sure we are getting our customers the food they want, when they want, when they want it. Our tie-up with Asda means we can help people access everything from store cupboard essentials to fresh groceries in a matter of minutes.” Just Eat follows rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which already have fast delivery deals with some of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. Best-known for restaurant and fast food delivery, Just Eat said that up to 1,000 grocery items would be made available for customers to order seven days a week. The two companies anticipate the partnership to be extended to more Asda stores throughout next year. The partnership builds on an existing relationship, with Just Eat delivering pizzas and meal deals from Asda Kitchen, the grocer’s indoor cafe and diner, which operates at 42 locations nationwide. “We’re always looking for new ways to offer customers more choice and extend the number of delivery options available,” said Simon Gregg, the vice-president of online grocery at Asda. “The trial will also see Asda become more accessible to a wider customer base through Just Eat’s significant presence in the on-demand food delivery space.” Just Eat has more than 60,000 restaurant partners it offers a delivery service for, covering 95% of the UK. The food delivery service has more than 10,000 grocery and convenience store partners on its platform internationally, including brands such as Spar, Shell and 7-Eleven.

Four out of about 100 managers at Spoons pubs were chosen after shareholders and employees said it would ""benefit from having more pub experience at board level"", the company said on Monday. Debbie Whittingham, a regional manager for the West Midlands, and Hudson Simmons, a manager for Sheffield, will join the board, while another two will be ""assistant employee directors"". Tim Martin, Wetherspoon’s founder and chairman, has previously slammed those who have criticised the company’s corporate governance in lengthy letters published on the stock market’s news service. But he said: Pub and area managers and other pub teams have always been involved in weekly decision-making meetings, which draw suggestions from the ‘front line’. The appointment of employee directors will extend this approach to board meetings and will help to preserve the culture of the company for the future. It was welcomed by the High Pay Centre, a think tank on pay, corporate governance. Worker directors can improve customer service. They can also improve employee relations. The new Wetherspoons directors would have more credibility and independence if they were elected by colleagues. Now they are appointed by existing board members. Boardroom representation is a complement to full trade union rights. It's not a substitute for them. But this is a positive step by Wetherspoons that will benefit both workers and shareholders in the long term. One to watch on the UK politics front: the prime minister has called a cabinet meeting at 2pm."
"As Andrew Sparrow points out on the Guardian’s UK politics live blog, there is not usually a cabinet meeting on a Monday, so this is an emergency coronavirus meeting. Dress codes and wine pairings have not yet been released. You can follow updates on the cabinet here: One for the central bank watchers: Germany’s new government has picked a new head of its central bank: “career central banker” Joachim Nagel. Nagel’s predecessor, Jens Weidmann, was perhaps the European Central Bank’s most prominent internal critic -arguing against the stimulus that it has used to prop up the EU economy. (All eurozone central bank heads get a place on the governing council, which sets monetary policy for the bloc.) Nagel, a former Bundesbank board member, will take over on 1 January. Reuters summarised his recent career as: A former board member of the state-owned development bank KfW Bank, Nagel currently works for the Bank for International Settlements, which is often considered the central bank of central banks. Early in his career, he was also a consultant for the SPD, the party that took over government earlier this month and will make the Bundesbank appointment one of its first decisions. Germany’s finance minister under the new coalition government, Christian Lindner, said on Monday: In view of inflation risks, the importance of a stability-oriented monetary policy is growing. He is an experienced personality who ensures continuity at the Bundesbank. The World Economic Forum at Davos has been postponed to the summer because of concerns about the coronavirus variant, it said on Monday. The event, usually held every year at the Swiss ski resort, was scheduled for 17 to 21 January 2022, but will instead happen in “early summer”.

"In a statement, the event’s organisers said: Current pandemic conditions make it extremely difficult to deliver a global in-person meeting. Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary. The number of shoppers across British high streets fell over the weekend before Christmas, according to new data from Springboard that show people spurned city centre shopping during what should have been the biggest weekend of the year. Retail footfall was 19% down for the week ending on Saturday compared to the equivalent in 2019, Springboard said - although it was higher than December 2020, when the UK government dramatically u-turned to put in place a Christmas lockdown. Shopping centres fared particularly badly, with footfall down by 27% on 2019, but high streets were also down by a fifth on 2019. Retail parks, which are generally accessed by private car and are often open-air, performed slightly better. Weekend traffic overall fell compared to the previous weekend by 8.5% in Central London and by 6.4% in cities outside of the capital. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: The nervousness of shoppers about making in-person shopping visits inevitably meant that large city centres lost out to smaller high streets, particularly over the weekend when footfall declined from the week before in Central London and large cities outside of the capital whilst rising in market towns. There has been a bit of movement on currency markets as well this morning: sterling is down by 0.4% against the US dollar. One pound will buy $1.3195. That in itself is not a huge move, but it puts the pound perilously close to its lowest level since December 2020, when the UK was facing the prospect of belated Christmas restrictions in the hope of limiting the spread of a new coronavirus variant (a familiar tale). If it drops below $1.3165 it will mark a new low for 2021, an unusual situation considering the Bank of England only just last week shocked markets with an interest rate rise - pre-empting the Federal Reserve. However, the Fed has itself also made it clear that it will tighten the US money supply. The prospect of a series of interest rate rises next year has made the dollar more attractive to investors.","In a statement, the event’s organisers said: The current pandemic conditions make it very difficult to hold a global meeting in person.

"Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the dollar will be, pace the omicron variant, one of the “winners from global growth” during 2022. There has also been a similar bounce on oil markets. The price of Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, is still down by 3.3% today - but that is a recovery from earlier.

"That means that there will be lower liquidity and fewer buyers to soak up any sales, so moves can be exaggerated. Nevertheless, that is a notable swing over the course of less than an hour. It may have been partly helped by vaccine maker Moderna. It said on Monday (in an interview published at 10am GMT) that a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to offer protection against the omicron variant. Reuters reported: The vaccine maker said the decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently discovered variant is spreading. The company still plans to develop a vaccine specifically to protect against Omicron, which it hopes to advance into clinical trials early next year. “What we have available right now is 1273,” Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer, said in an interview. “It’s highly effective, and it’s extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we’re going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.” Some detail on how the UK’s shops fared over the last week - usually one of the the strongest of the year: it was not great. Footfall on and near London’s Oxford Street, the country’s biggest shopping district, was 17% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the New West End Company, which represents about 600 shops. Shopping was 5% below the previous weekend, and across the entire week of the 13th December footfall was down by 29% compared with 2019’s figures. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said businesses were “disappointed” with how the weekend went: With less than five days to go until Christmas day and the probabilities of a circuit-breaker lockdown increasingly on the horizon, the retail and leisure sector is now facing a huge amount of financial uncertainty when it should be enjoying a much needed shot in the arm. We are therefore backing the #BusinessBooster campaign and calling on the government to provide urgent and swift financial support.

"The FTSE 100 sell-off has accelerated - it is now down by 2.2%. It has hit the lowest level since the start of December as concern over the spread of the omicron variant ramp up. While the UK government is fielding a lot of questions about parties, the hospitality industry is trying to put the pressure on over the lack of them, given how the current lockdown-lite has affected their bookings. The Guardian’s Joanna Partridge writes: Pubs and restaurants have warned of plummeting sales and “decimated” bookings, as pressure increases on the government to offer urgent financial support to struggling hospitality businesses. The weekend just passed should have been the busiest trading period of the Christmas season, but customers chose to stay away, said Nick Mackenzie, the chief executive of the pub and brewery chain Greene King, which runs 2,700 pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK. “Demand has dropped, bookings have been decimated, some parts of the country we are 70%, 80% down on 2019, so the situation is pretty unsustainable,” Mackenzie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday. Warnings from the government had led to “lockdown in all but name”, Mackenzie said, and he urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to deliver “quick and effective support”.
